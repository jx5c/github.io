n this week's three video we have presented we have policy the quite a few videos discounting the public key certificate so this is a this is a very challenging topic and this is what you widely used it's not a perfect solution but it seems that at this moment we don't really have a lot of good problem we do not have a lot of good solution so let's back up a few steps and understand why do we needed a certificate okay so so if you will recall we're discussing the big problem is that we have two parties outlets and ABAB and that they want to establish a secure encryption key so that they can communicate with each other without worrying about the problem caused by the eavesdropper okay and symmetric encryption if we only use symmetric key is a very hard problem because now Alice and Obama either have to arrange something beforehand they have a secret key establish that even before the communication or they have to go through a key distribution center which either way we have explained it's not really a very attractive approach so fortunately for us we have this public private key encryption algorithm invented it and now we can use the public key to encrypt the symmetric session key so that you can use this key to communicate and then the the symmetric encryption key will only be used before this communication may be 10 minutes 15 minutes or 2 hour after two hour with this cut it so in this way we don't have to worry about it and then the next time we need to communicate we can build a brand new key so very fair and very good approach and then we introduced this Mendham in attack which basically means okay Alice has some public-key and Alice could not just deliver the public key directly to Baba because whoever is sitting in between will be able to replace Alice's public key with another public key and you will not be able to differentiate the difference okay okay so let's be set so if we have this we have this Alice and Bob we cannot just the let Alice send out her public key in clear text because this will really cause a lot of problem because the bad guy can actually replace this card okay so what is the approach or what is the current solution that we are adopting it's very interesting people invented something called a certificate what is a certificated it's a certificate is basically we try to find an ID basically identity of a person or an agency or a company and it's his or her it's public key together okay this is a certificate that's its certificate of course in the post in the video you can see that the certificate format is actually much more complicated than this if you look at the video it has to what version of the certificate we're talking about who is the easier what's the serial number of the certificate what is the ID of the person or agency or company that you are using the certificate for what is public key what encryption algorithm you are using what the expiration date so if you watch that video you will see there is a complete list of what's in the certificate but most importantly if we you know back off one step and what is a certificate a certificate is basically it contains three things one is it ID why is the public key and then there is an expiration time and the whole thing will be digitally signed by the certificate easier actually sometime they call it C a which is certificate authority okay so if this is the case let's see what do we got so now when Alice sends something to Bob is not her public key directly in clear-text on the contrary it is a certificate it's a certificate signed by an CA okay we're gonna discuss who can be the CA and why the heck would we even trust a CA but let's see so now let's look at look at this problem now we have Bob said hey Alice wrong button that click ok so now Bob said hey Alice I won't talk to you securely so why don't you give me your public key and Alice's sure thing instead of sending Bob her real public key directly Alice will send out the certificate of Alice okay and what is the certificate like we just that's that it is basically a signature digital sign difficulys sign a message and I don't know who will be the signer but let's say this is very signed we're going to see who are those trusted signers so we have the digital signature oh very sign it says oh this is Alice's identity this is the public key of Alice and this public key will be valid until December 31st 2016 ok Bob will read save this thing and then now if Bob okay there's a big Eve here if Bob if bob has very signs publicy if bob has very signs public-key he will be able to open the message open the certificate okay and when he opened the certificate he will be able to see that oh this is ID this is the public key of alice and this will be the expiration date and Bob will look at his clock and said okay it's before the expiration date so everything is fine and this is Alice and this is public key and now he can securely to use the public key of alice to encrypt the message and send it out send it out and only the owner of the private key which should also be Alice will be able to open this message will be able to open this message okay so this is a pretty straightforward approach using certificate but there are quite a few problems we needed to handle we needed to handle okay the first thing first we need answer one question let's see we have a first question from whom kimbap get to the certificate okay so Bob said hey Alice I want to talk to you I want to talk to you securely so to make sure we're not under man-made attack why don't you give me your certificate okay so obviously Bob will get the certificate from CA Bob will send a message to the CA said no CA I want Alice's public could you provide me a copy the CA will provide him a copy or Bob could also get Alice's certificated from Alice from Alice okay because when the see a sign Alice's certificate the C will definitely provide a copy to Alice so it's very possible that Bob goes to Alice said hey Alice I want talk to his security but I want to see your certificate to make sure it is really your public key but not anybody else okay that's pretty normal this is a question the question is can Bob ask analyst is certificate from a third party even you know consider the cases that the third party may be malicious can Bob get certificate of Alice from a third party even if the third party is malicious surprisingly yes surprisingly yes why what so when we answer why it's still possible for Bob to get a certificate of Alice from a certain party even if the third party's malicious we have to understand one thing okay what is the root of security what is the root of security of a cert of a certificate what is the root of the security of the security of the cert it's the digital signature of the CA the reason that Baba trust this is Alice and that this is really Alice's public key but not but anybody else's is provided by the digit hosting nature of the CA it does not come from where this thing was provided okay why so let's say Bob want something from Alice Bob said hey Alice why don't you give me your certificate and Alice will sand Bob her certificate and of course if you're familiar with tcp/ip you'll know there's a source IP address and destination IP address and then the message okay remember in tcp/ip this source IP address is clear text for the bad guy whoever sitting in between could block this packet and replace as part in other words whoever is the bad guy even you have em he will be able to send out a packet in Alice's name so he can say I'm Alice I'm sending this thing out so under that case okay it does not really matter it's the certificate come from the end or come from Alice or come from the CA the safety of the certificate come from the digital signature of the CA not come from the sources the identity of the sources okay so now let's zoom in a little bit and see what really happens so you may say that well but you know if if we get the certificate of Alice from M what will happen so let's look at this thing okay so we have Alice we have the bad guy M Alice has her real certificate sir eh M also has a copy of Sir egg how can em get a certificate of Alice that's very normal the M could just say hey Alice I want to talk to you could you please give me as a copy of your certificate so that I know it's really your public key Alice cannot differentiate who is malicious Alice will definitely send a copy to him and M will also of course has a copy of the certificate of M himself himself okay and what is implied by that Alice is really Alice Alice also know the private key of Alice and what about M and has a copy of his own private key okay so now let's see we have bought here so Bob said hey Alice give me your certificate so that we can talk security so Alice will send the certificate to Bob Bob uh verify the signature to Baba verify the signature understand this is really Alice's public key and use the public key to encrypt the message to Alice okay now the question is who can open this message if you want to open this message the only thing you need is your private key is the corresponding private key Alice will be able to open this message because Alice has a private key Kemba can the malicious Gaiam open this malicious message unfortunately no M only has the private key of M he does not have the private key of Alice okay so let's see if M is seeking in between I mean sitting in between and the between Alice and Bob and Bob said hey I want your public key PM said sure this is my chance to conduct a man-made attack can M send out a cert M to Bob well you can sure you can surely send a certain to Bob but this is answer certificate it will contain Ann's name amps public key and amps expiration date so Bob will be able to open it up and see oh okay I won Alice's public key but this is you know certificate of M so it's really nice that I have this certificate but unfortunately it's useless for me so the M cannot really send out certain because this will not help him what about the end send out a really sir a that's okay that's okay so Bob will verify the certificate of a and figure out that it's really Alice this is Alice's public key and remember once Bob verify this certificate Bob will encrypt the message with really with Alice's real public key okay Baba will not increment a message with Ann's public key so Bob will send out a message with Alice's public key and ascended out and M can receive it the problem is whatever the message is is encrypted by the public key of Alice and we'll be able to eat drop on it but M will not be able to open it because you needed a private key of Alice to open it up okay for the next thing which will be real directly related to actually to the next question we than we needed to answer about the certificate which is what about M generate a fake certificate can M generate a fake certificate well if M can generate a fake certificate what does that mean that basically means M can sign on behalf I'm sorry of the CA or in other words the CA has been compromised so the CAS private key is compromised and then basically M can sign and limiting the number of certificate agency aides named under that case the CA is totally ruined the CA is totally ruined okay okay so we answer the first question is from whom can we get the certificate of a person so basically it can come from the person himself or herself it can come from a certificate authority or it can come from any party okay so if you want to know and other parties certificate it can come from any sources as long as you can successfully verify the digital signature of this
