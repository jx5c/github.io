okay the second question which weary sav-a-lot does this solve the problem I'm sorry well the answer is yes and no let's say wise and yes and no ok so we have LS we have Bob at the very beginning we said hope Bob this is Alice and this is my public key and of course the bad guy can replace this part we're facing a problem so now we have a certificate we said oh wait a minute we cannot ascend out the public key of Alice in clear text on the contrary we need a tools sign a digitally sign a message so what do we have we have a signed message with the private key of Verisign let's say Verisign and we have alice and we have pop alice and we have the time i don't have enough space so i do not write the complete expiration date here but I just write down a name in time you know do you understand what we're talking about okay so now Bob will receive a digitally signed a message okay remember it is signed by the private key of Verisign now the question is how can Baba verify that thing if Bob needs to verify the saying he needed the public key of Verisign that is why in the earlier video I said to certificated does not really solve the problem completely what it actually does is like let me let us push the problem to a higher level so if you'll recall in the other video I said basically in the old time we said oh we need a little public key somehow we need it so now we can verify it so what do we say we said oh um let's wrap Alice's public key in a message which is signed by a very sign or whoever is the certificate issue and then to verify it you needed a public key of the very sign so now instead of we you can gather the public key of Alice if you want to get a public key of Alice securely now you needed a public key of the certificate of Verisign or Wells Fargo whoever is easily so we're just pushing the problem one layer up it's like we're asking oh do we have chicken first or do we have egg first we said oh yes we needed to deliver the egg security okay but if we want to egg we need to first have a chicken and this wait a minute where does the chicken from oh the chicken was hatched from the egg so basically we are we are not solving the problem completely you were just pushing it up or just pushing up okay so now we have a problem we need to answer now so basically we say well the certificate idea is great right the only problem is where can Bob get this public key of the Verisign or whoever is the CA and then you know how can we make sure it is true okay so now fortunately for us or unfortunately for us the public key the public keys of the CAS are embedded it into your OS or of your OS or your browser what do we mean okay so let's I will show you a the following part and you will understand okay so if you look at the screen we basically what are we showing here we are showing the Firefox browser we're showing the Firefox browser okay so now if you go to the right most open menu click it and option okay so you can open here you can set up the general things whether or not you keep history what is the security and privacy and at the leftmost bottom one that's called advanced and in the advanced you have a general data troy's network update and on the rightmost there is something called a certificate something called a certificate open click it and on the bottom you'll see view certificate and a secure security device so click on the view certificate a new window will pop up unfortunately other is right here okay so this is the window you'll pop up and well I do not have any certificated that for myself okay and there's no people no server there's some server but let's see this called Authority this are basically you have the certificate on file that identified this certificate authority in other words your computer knows or your browser knows the public key of this guy's in other words anything that is signed by the following agencies your brother will be able to verify that your brother will be able to verify that okay so the top part there are many names that we don't really understand what we don't recognize but let's go to the bottom okay and see a few names that we are pretty familiar with okay so first we have Wells Fargo Wells Fargo secure public routes certificate it's built in object token so basically your browser will trust Wells Fargo's signature anything you sold by the Wells Fargo check Wells Fargo could be a CA and of course right above Wells Fargo is something you recognize you see it very frequently a visa with a certificate authority and the right above that we have this famous name very signed so if you have purchased something online you'll see this very very frequently and of course Turkish is there another name we have a Taiwan CA Swisscom I assume this is a company from Switzerland our essay so our essay is a big security company I believe the company was purchased or acquired by the EMC square which is a storage company so yeah so now they yield a certificate as well just want to see whether or not Japanese government so basically is backed up by their Hongkong post oh okay famous name you'll see this thing every year in the Superbowl advertisement Go Daddy it's basically most of time or two girls advertisement yeah if you recall I will be surprised if there is not a Chinese government certificated trusted by Dutch come sign okay China Internet a network information sorry of course China financial certificate oh sorry of course so you got the idea okay you got the idea most browsers will allow you to install mute certificate for example you feel work for Microsoft Microsoft will probably will issue some certificate is signed by the company and your browser will not recognize it immediately but you could import it or in other words you can install this certificate into your brother set please sign please trust anything that is signed by this so from now if you actually used all that your brother will cost anything signed by Microsoft okay so you can always import you can always import a new certificate into your root so that you will trust everything signed by that okay so back to our earlier point so now the public keys of CAS are embedded into your OSF browser if you use other browser like Chrome or Microsoft IE which I don't know how many of you are still using Microsoft IE but you can you can find all the information you know brother no matter what browser you're using okay so now is very interesting now we have two more problems we need to discuss so the second problem is okay we really solve the problem the second about business business model CA okay so what is a CA so the basically C has a huge so the hit ca has his own public key and a private key and then the ca will just sit here and the companies will come to the ca said I want a signature of my public key and that the ca will said okay let me see your ID and driver's license and everything I will verify that you are really who you claim yourself to be after the verification I'm just going to sign this certificate and of course you can imagine the signature is not for free so let's say here is $1,000 you I need to charge you $1,000 for one year I will sign you a certificate which will be expired in exactly one year pay me $1,000 and here is the certificate here the corresponding private key if you want me to generate a private key or you could generate your own private key either way okay let's say I charge $1,000 for one year and the next year if you still want to use my certificate you will come back I will sign you a new certificate charge your $1,000 now you can see well this is you said well this is good this is really good business model because you don't need anything you only need really a really a long public key and really really a long private key and you just sit there people come to your you charge them $1,000 and sign something and next year they come back again $1,000 it's like it's like your your you are renting out a house but the only good thing is that you don't even have to purchase the house people who have just come to you well it's not that easy so well you can see what is so well let's say that that is really a good business model okay the only thing is what the only thing is that your private key got to be safe your private key got to be safe in other words if God forbid your private key or server got compromised the bad guy got their hand on your private key then the bad guy will be able to sign anything with your private key that basically means or the certificate that you sign will become nothing will be totally white people will no longer trust the certificate that you'll sign so basically if the bad guy compromised your server sign fixed certificate and they call different places and then immediately all the major company will say that oh okay well the browser will said stop accepting the certificate is signed by this company because it has been compromised you're totally ruined and when after all the browser tell the browser to set okay stop accepting the certificate is signed by this company what does that mean to your company to your CA company you're totally screwed why because nobody will come to you asking for pay you let $1000 because your private key has been compromised no browser will accept your certificate then if nothing there's no use for me to get a certificate a sign it's like oh um you know I sit in my house and I'm just issuing driver's license well I can charge very cheap fee to ething driver's license but that is useless because whenever this guy got stopped by a police officer they would say this is fake driver's license we're gonna arrest you so nobody will really come to me to get my driver's license that's exactly the same thing here once you're compromised well the brothers will set stop accepting certificate your business is totally relieved you're totally totally cooked unfortunately this thing happens quite a few times so let's say well the Camellia page so I cannot guarantee the accuracy but there if you google and you will see similar things happen at different places so let's say did you know table was a Dutch certificate authority okay this is a CA who either certificate on the buy of a blog on September 3rd 2011 after it had become clear that a security breach had a result hidden in the front line assuring of certificate so basically something bad happens you are starting you are starting to ezo fake certificate the Dutch government took over the operational management of this company that same month the company was declared bankrupt so basically yes it's a good business model that you don't have to do anything people just come to your door you to sign something they pay you $1,000 next year they will come back ok so it's really sounds really attractive the only problem is the model will operate as long as that signature is still valuable the moment that your server got compromised you're totally contrary or political and the only thing you can do is probably declare bankrupt if my memory is correct there was another similar issue the company is rooted in either New York or New Jersey I cannot remember exactly which state but it's in the New England area I think it happened in 2013 the certificate oh sorry he got compromised they sign fake certificate outside and then the company cup become bankruptcy again so you can see this is this is this is a well it is a good business model but then it's possible that something bad could happen to you okay so now we have answer three questions and then we have to discuss about one more thing is what about the certificate got compromised so let's say number four what if your security key got compromised okay imagine this imagine this okay the CA gives you assert and in the cert it has your name in your public key and your expiration date and of course the CA said hey dude this is your private key you'll keep it in a safe place because you're going to use this to decrypt and sign okay so god forbid you put it in your computer but somehow your computer got stolen or your computer got compromised somebody get their hands on your private key so your clock that because now okay ooh we have a very very bad thing happening because your private key got compromised that basically means the bad guy will be able to sign on your book behalf it's just like your credit card got stolen so what do you do you immediately call the credit card company cancel or freeze your credit card right similarly if your private key can compromise your immediate call the CA said Oh something bad happens I need to avoid my certificate okay and we need to void the certificate so now what can we do there are actually two things we can do to help you okay so first thing first all the CAS or the CAS will issue it's something called a certificate revocation list it's called a CRL something called certificated revocation lists appear radically for example every 24 hours so certificate authority will publish a certificate revocation instead said okay this cert has been compromised stopping your thing it stopped yielding it so basically you call the company the company and your certificated into this revocation list and the tomorrow 6 a.m. the company will publish the new crl every every place every browser every place will download this new crl and keep a copy of that and then if they receive this certificated they said oh this thing has been revoked we cannot accept it it so we cannot negotiate with you you need to get a new cert ok so this is a very easy way this is more like a centralized approach so if your certificate got compromised content of the CA say put your certificate in the CRL publish it tomorrow ok the problem is the certificated relocation lift it cannot be published in real time it cannot be like the certificate authority will publish every second oh a new certificate list a new list a new list there is a delay for example there's a 24-hour delay well I'm not just making it up it could be 8 hours it could be 48 hours but you know there's a delay well that's I mean that basically means from the moment you figure out that it has been stolen there could be a 24-hour delay that everybody knows that there's something bad happened and the weeds in this window your certificated will still be accepting it in other words the bad guy has your private key he or she will be able to sign on your behalf and it'll be accepted it and we know that if you do not figure out your credit card was stolen for 24 hours that's a very bad thing I could make a big damage to your credit history okay so the CRL is good it has been used for a long time we're still using it but there is a delay okay what is an alternative approach an alternative approach is actually this protocol is called online certificate status protocol it's called OCSP is an internet protocol used for obtaining the revocation status of an x.509 digital certificate it was created as an alternative to the CRL specifically addressing certain problems associated with using sarolea public key infrastructure so basically instead of waiting for 24 hours whenever I received when I receive assert after average sale assert I will using this online certificate status protocol to contact the CIA said oh I Rea save a certificate easier to buy you easy that's still available it is still valid and that the city will tell me yes it's valid or no it has been revoked stop using it okay in other words the OCSP provide a real-time relocation capability now the moment that you call the seeds at my private key got compromised the CH @ oops bad bad bad stop using this cert it will become the status will be desert will become bad and then if I contact the seeds that existing still available using this OCSP protocol the certificate authority will say oh stop using it it has been compromised so this thing can be done immediately in other words as soon as you report your cert is compromised or your private key is compromised or your credit card is stolen the credit card company will freeze it immediately so this will help us to solve some problems related to the to the certificate compromise easy okay so of course if you search on your chill but you will notice that there are many many many complaining and there are many many research papers on the effective if effectiveness of the certificate so unfortunately until until now we're still using it that that means the certificate is the best approach actually not I don't believe this is a good approach the only problem is now we do not really have an out good alternative for it if you watch the previous video you'll notice that there are identity based encryption in other words your identity itself is your public key so the idea is great and a very very attractive but there are some technical issues we still we have not fully overcome we still need to work on it so yeah the certificate is not really it's not really attractive or sexy but so far it's still widely used and we do not really have a good alternative for it yet so I hope this answers some of your concern or questions about certificate and remember we have this midterm exam okay make sure you put it on your calendar and have a co for the next session Thanks
