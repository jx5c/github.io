good morning everyone and welcome back to 30 to 60 to 180 200 so the IPS fellows finally reinstall the whole Camtasia thing onto my computer and let's see the quality of the product ok so we are going to continue we're going to continue our introduction on the ethereal knowledge proof in the previous slides in the previous video we actually provide you some information and especially we introduce the general procedure of zero knowledge proof first Alice need to generate a brand new problem based on wait a second ok so Alice will generate a new problem based on original one and the two problems they needed to be isomorphic in other words the difficulty level should be the same so you should not convert the original problem to a simpler or a more difficult problem and that we're going to see this is actually a very tricky part ok and the Bombers should not be able to find an easy matter to transfer back to the original problem otherwise we're going to be in big trouble and then Alice will commit to the solution of the new problem to Bob with a don't worry about the big commitment protocol so basically you need to generate a commitment of the solution what does we mean by generate the commitment of solution a commitment is basically it's a bound between two parties from Alice's point I commit to the solution which means I could not easily change it on the other side Bob again the commitment but will not be able to actually figure out the solution however Bob can easily to detect the weather law of Alice has changed for example what is a good commitment a hash result is a good commitment okay so let's say I have a very complicated question and I know the solution and I generated a hash result of the solution and I hand you over I hand you over the hand you over the hash result so this is a commitment why because if hash function is really a good collision-free hash function that basically means this hash result is generated from my message or from my solution I could not change it because if I change it the hash result will be different and you can easily detect it on the other side when you look at the hash without it will be extremely hard for you to figure out what really the solution is so this type of commitment and then Bobby will be able to challenge Alice with one of the following problems the first problem is that you need to prove that the two questions that are actually as a morphic or you show me the solution to the new problem either way so but you cannot challenge the both of them and then the procedure will repeat until Bob is satisfied okay so this is the general procedure and now let us show two real examples one is the graph isomorphic problem so before this video we actually posted two videos from YouTube one is what are a graph isomorphism problem and the second is what is a Hamedan cycle of a graph so what are draft as a morphic problem so basically the two graphs we call them as a Moffitt if you can find a one-to-one vertex mapping between the two graph and at the same time if there is one edge existing in the original graph there is another corresponding edge exists in the second map to graph and the vice versa so the edge and the vertex they have this one-to-one mapping and the two graphs are exactly the same structure okay surprisingly determine that or not two graphs that are actually as a morphic is a very challenging problem if you pay some attention to the advance inside science computer science you will notice that about one or two months ago the University of Chicago researchers make some big progress on the determination of the graph isomorphism they propose some efficient algorithm but our course is not about graph theory the groceries were actually a very very complicated problem field and it's full of math so we're not going there but let's say we now we know that graph isomorphic problem is a very difficult problem and we're going to use this to construct a zero knowledge proof example okay so if you look at the whiteboard okay so now we have two graphs we have graph G 1 and graph G 2 and of course we need to have our old friends Alice and Bob in this exam meaning this problem solving problem so let's say these two graphs they are very very complicated but there is a rumor in the society that the two graphs are actually as a morphic okay so one day Alice come to Bob said hey Bob you know what I figure out that at evil energy to are actually has some office so what does it mean to you and T to isomorphic Alice actually no actually knows a vertex mapping between the nodes in g1 and the nodes in g2 so Alice actually no such a vertex mapping okay and the Bob is of course Bob is very excited said really really tell me tell me Allison no I'm not going to tell you if I tell you that then you will know the vertex mapping between t1 and t2 so I don't want you to know so they said hmm that's an interesting problem so what are we going to do let us run the zero knowledge proof approach so that Alice can prove to Bob that she actually knows the vertex mapping between the two graphs at the same time at the end of the whole thing at the end of the whole procedure Bob will learn nothing about it okay so we have introduced attitude zero knowledge proof oops we have where have you introduced that to do zero knowledge proof we may need to run many rounds and for every rounds you can reduce the probability that Alice can cheat you to a value of smaller than 1 or smaller than 100% and when we run it again again eventually the probability that Alice can cheat you for 30 rounds continuously will reach 0 okay and for this graph isomorphic problem this is how we are going to conduct a single round of experiment so first Alice will generate a new graph let's call that g3 first the thing is Alice will generate a brand new grab g3 so let us say that Alice generated t3 based on t1 so basically she manipulates the position of the notes of g1 so you drag all the notes everywhere so then the ads will change correspondingly and you get a brand new figure t3 and of course since you generated t3 based on t1 those two graphs are isomorphic and the Alice knows exactly how the notes or vertex are mapped but twin G 1 and T 3 okay now let's look at t2 now let's look at G 2 so let us assume that the Teva energies who are really a somatic and Alice knows that how the vertex in t1 should be mapped to vertex in t2 for example palettes know that the node a in T 1 should be mapped to know the five in G 2 and the B in T 1 should be a hundred and four in G 2 so on and so forth so Alice actually know the note mapping and of course Alice generated T 3 from t1 so Alice know that the node a in G one actually is the same as know the rabbit so we needed to come out with a system with naming the different notes so basically every node in G 323 is an animal in t1 is a character in t2 is number okay so Alice generated g3 from t1 so Alice knows that Oh no the and1 is actually no the rabbit in t3 and alice also note that this node a and g 1 equals to know the five in G - so this rapid G 3 and the 5 T 2 are actually the vertex mapping between T 23 in other words if I know how the nodes are mapped between G 1 and G 3 and G 1 and G 2 Alice will also know how the nodes are mapped between t2 and t3 so in other words now we have G 1 G 2 G 3 they are all isomorphic and also Alice knows how the knows how the vertex between or among those three figures are supposed to be mapped to each other okay so now Alice will generate a new graph G 3 which is as a morphic 2 T 1 and as well as as a morphic 2 T 3 T 2 so now we have the three graphs they are exactly as a morphic to each other and Alice k FG 3 - Bob - Bob and then of course it's the challenging part Bob can challenge can challenge Alice with one with I'm sorry with one of the following two questions Baba will challenge Alice with one of the following two questions the first question is that to show the vertex mapping the twin g1 and the g3 I'm sorry what happens there is something interesting or Bob can chat challenge Alice to show the vertex mapping between think about it between G to remember G 3 is the Brendan you'll figure that Alex generate based on C 1 M G - ok so basically we already know that the T 1 G 2 G 3 they're all as a morphic and the the thing or the question that Alice want to prove to Bob that she actually knows that vertex mapping between geology - ok so now what do we have we have G 1 and G 2 and Alice generate 83 and we know that G 1 G 3 are as amorphic G 2 and G 3 are isomorphic okay and the Bob can ask Alice to either expose the vertex mapping between this two or the vertex mapping between this tool because if Alice tell Bob that okay I will tell you how the g1 and g3 are mapped with each other that you can easily verify ok this vertex is is mapped to this node that this word has mapped to this node and you can verify every edge so if there is an edge in g1 there should be a corresponding edge in T 3 similarly right and a similarity for T 2 and T 3 40:23 okay so this is what Bob will ask Alice to do and Alice will answer this question okay if Alice could not answer the challenge what does that mean that basically means Oh Alice you don't know a thing you don't know how the nose or vertexes into energy to are mapped to each other on the contrary if Alice can accomplish this task okay and there we have to look at this from a different approach okay so now let's look at these two things so I do not I run out of space so I have to eliminate whatever I have written here so basically Alice will generate a brand new graph that is as a morphic to both of the G - G - and a let's give the new graph to Bob and the Bob will challenge Alice to prove either g1 and g3 how the nodes are mapped or g2 and g3 are mapped okay so now let's look at this problem so now Bob challenge Alice Bob challenge Alice okay there are a few things we need to clarify we need to clarify okay first if Alice fails the challenge so if Alice fail the challenge then Alice lied in other words Alice does not know the word tax mapping between and tybg to second if Alice succeed that it proved that Alice actually know the vertex mapping between t1 and t2 not necessary why why we're going to see we're going to draw the figure again you understand so I have a t1 and I have a g2 okay so let's say I have nothing I know nothing about how the vertex between G 1 and G 2 are mapped okay I have absolutely no knowledge about how the word tags are mapped so we draw a dotted line which basically means I don't know I know nothing about and then I can generate a t3 I can generate the t3 what does I mean I will generate a t3 by either manipulating or change the position of the note in g1 or I can generate the t3 by manipulating the notes so so let's say Alice does not know anything about the vertex mapping between t1 t2 so she can still either manipulate g1 to generate a g3 or she can manipulate the g2 to generate a g3 and here I call the t3 prime to differentiate the g3 above okay so even if I know nothing about the vertex mapping between the two figures on g2 I can steal either I can generate the t3 either through manipulating g1 or through manipulating g2 however since I don't know anything about the vertex mapping that on 22 I can generate the t3 based on t1 then that means this edge is a target Act which basically means if you challenge me with the vertex mapping between t2 and t3 I could not answer you because I have no idea and then on the contrary if I have generated a t3 prime with t2 through manipulating g2 I will not know a thing about the vertex mapping between G 1 and G 3 prime so either way okay so what does that mean that basically means even if Alice is lying even if Alice is lying okay Alice has nothing has no knowledge about how the vertex mapping the 21 a g2 she can still take a wild guess because I think Bob will challenge me on this side I think Bob will challenge me on this side I think Bob will challenging me on g1 and g3 vertex mapping so I will generate the t3 from t1 okay and if Bob actually challenge Alice on this side I will be able to fool you I will be able to cheat you if he challenged me on this side and flunk and flug so what does that mean even if Alice can successfully answer the challenge from Bob if we are only running one round if we're only running one round Alice has 50% chance to cheat Bob so even if Alice knows nothing about it if we run this thing only one round Alice has 50% chance to cheat bomb okay so if what single round you have 50% chance to achieve me what am I going to do I'm going to run it 20 round sir do you know 40 rounds every route actual round I run I will reduce your chance to fool me continuously by half and believe me this thing will decrease very very fast okay so from this point of view it looks very similar to the earlier example of you know Bob a let's go through the caveman the secret cave secret the door thing so every round you have about 50% chance to fool me but if I run in many many times then you are competent okay sir problem sir problem sir problem why will Alice all they respond to one of the two questions why will a let's respond to only one of the two challenges but not both of them but not both of them well remember what we want is a zero knowledge proof we don't want tell Bob a bit of the information okay so if you look at this figure if Alice really know the notes were text mapping between G 1 and G 2 and of course if she generated G 3 she will be able to know the vertex mapping between T 1 T 3 and T 23 okay so if Alice if if Bob a challenge to question to Alice and Alice if Alice answer only when of it for example Alice enter this side so now Bob will know G 1 and T 3 there as a morphic and he will know exactly how the vertex are mapped between each other can Bob based on this part of information figure out the vertex mapping between G 1 and G 2 well Bob has two ways of doing that one is Bob directly try to figure out the mapping between Co energy 2 or if Bob can figure out that the vertex mapping between t2 and t3 between this tool so if I know how the notes are mapped between this two nodes within this to graph and the Alice already told me how the vertex are mapped in this two figures I can figure out this edge okay so now look let's look at this approach if you remember a very important property of zero knowledge proof you have to show that should knock Bob should not find an easy matter to transfer back to the original problem so I give you the solution to the new problem you will I'd be able to easily transfer it back okay so let's look at this let's look at it this case okay so I tell you this can you easily figure out the word hex mapping between g2 and g3 well the effort that is needed to figure out the vertex mapping between g2 and g3 is exactly the same as the effort that is needed to figure out that the vertex mapping between g1 and g2 so if you can solve this problem you will be able to solve this problem okay so from this point of view I give you half of the answer it will not help you to solve the original problem how about back to our earlier question why cannot Alice answer both of the challenge okay so if Alice responded to both challenge from Bob well that's I mean Alice will tell Bob how the vertex our math between g1 and g3 and the t2 and t3 so now what can bobbler bob will be able to learn the vertex mapping between g1 and g2 and then is no longer it is no longer a zero knowledge proof because now at the end of the question Bob will know the original secret okay so now this is a single round so let's go back to see how can we run multiple rounds okay so now Alice Alice has a t1 and t2 and of course Bob has this knowledge of t1 and t2 and then what Alice will do is Alice will generate this ray of course c4z five to six I'm sorry she's six blah blah blah and GOG 100 I think 100 won't be happy enough for Bob and then Bob will challenge Alice to either approve G 1 2 G 3 or T 2 T 3 or t1 to t4 and g2 to g4 but only one side so eventually what Bob will learn Bob will learn something look like this he knows how the t1 and t3 are mapped together he knows how to 24 are mapped together T 25 G 1 G 6 and the G 2 and G 500 so basically every time that you introduce an edge into the graph into this situation you introduce a new graph so you are never going to see a three-edged close the circle include the post t1 and t2 which you will be able to figure that so now for example you know t1 83 there are some of it g20 folders as a morphic so how can you figure out the vertex map ability to you either directly figure out between g1 g2 or you can figure out from the 23 and g4 if you know this edge god forbid we have this dotted line between this two if you know this mapping you can derive that out okay but in this way we guarantee that okay if Alice does know the vertex mapping the 2182 she will be able to answer every round of challenge if she does not know the vertex mapping the probability that she can answer this challenge successfully will be extremely low will be extremely ill and actually we can be any look ok as close to zero as you want at the same time the probability that Bob learns the challenge the answer to the challenge will also be very very low because solving the alternative problem has the same difficulty to solve the original problem so in this way we generated a zero knowledge proof without disclosing any information to Bob at the same time Alice is happy enough to answer the challenge of the Bob so this is one example question in real life that we can do with this zero knowledge proof
