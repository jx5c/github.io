in this video we'll learn what makes a graph Hamiltonian so first of all there is something called the Hamilton path and also a Hamilton cycle and the difference is pretty obvious because one is called Hamilton path and the other one is called Hamilton cycle a Hamilton path is a path but it has to touch every vertex of the graph so it covers every vertex once every vertex once and the once is not very confusing because in a path you cannot have repeated vertices so the big point is that a path is special it's called Hamilton if it covers all of the vertices and similarly a Hamilton cycle is probably you can guess what it is now a Hamilton cycle is a cycle that covers cycle that covers every vertex once every vertex once of course I should have setup here that this is a path that covers okay so that's pretty straightforward you just think of a cycle that hits all of the vertices of a graph and that will be a Hamilton cycle now we say that a graph is Hamiltonian if it has a Hamilton cycle so if there exists a Hamilton cycle Hamilton cycle the graph is Hamiltonian Hamiltonian so similarly when we said that a graph was oil arian if it had an oil aryan tour but not a nor Larian trail the same thing is happening here we say that its Hamiltonian if it has the Hamilton cycle not just if it has a Hamilton path so let's take a look at a graph for which we can find a Hamilton cycle so it will be Hamiltonian so let's take a look at an example of a Hamiltonian graph so this graph is actually called the cube for fairly obvious reasons it looks like a nice box or cube and what we can do is look carefully and find a Hamilton cycle so it's going to be a cycle in this graph which hits every vertex so for example we might start at this top left vertex and go down and then cross this to the face and then up using that edge now let's use this one down again use this edge come back up and across and hopefully it's clear you can see that we've hit all of the vertices 1 2 3 4 5 5 6 7 & 8 so this was a Hamilton cycle Hamilton cycle so the graph is Hamiltonian ok now one thing to point out is that if you have a Hamilton cycle like this and you just remove the very last edge that we use so we don't have this one being green then the result is a Hamilton path so a Hamilton cycle I'm going to write ham cycle can be converted to a Hamilton path to a Hamilton path by removing one edge and the result is simply a path that covers all of the vertices now I'd like to point out the following observation this graph that we have here is already Hamiltonian so if I was to add in an extra edge between two of these vertices the graph the results would still be Hamiltonian so in general if you have a Hamilton graph you can add more edges in as long as you don't add more vertices and you're guaranteed to still be Hamiltonian so we can repeat that by saying that if G is Hamiltonian is Hamiltonian then the super graph then will any super graph any super graph G Prime so what that means that G is in fact the sub graph of G prime where G prime is obtained by adding new edges between non adjacent vertices of G then G prime is also also Hamiltonian and that is very straightforward because the Hamilton cycle that worked for G will still work for G prime there are no new vertices that we have to worry about so we can actually use this observation to show something useful it should be very clear that the compiled on n vertices is Hamiltonian that should be straightforward because find a Hamilton cycle well it already is a Hamilton cycle it's a cycle that goes through all of its vertices so that is straightforward Hamiltonian the cycle CN is Hamiltonian now if we take a look at the complete graph on n vertices kN this is a super graph of the complete graph so this is like our G prime where our CN was our G so this complete graph is obtained from the cycle just by adding more edges for example if you think of the cycle on four vertices like this if you want now the complete graph on four vertices all you have to do is keep adding edges until you've got them all so by the observation above by the above observation we know then that K n is also Hamiltonian Hamiltonian right so keep that in mind if you're wondering why is the complete graph hamiltonian it's because it has the cycle CN as a sub graph of it and that cycle is itself the Hamilton cycle now unlike oil Arian graphs there's no nice theorem like we had with oil aryan graphs we said that a graph was all aryan if and only if all the vertices have even degree but there is no nice characterization that works for hamiltonian graphs and there's no nice algorithm either but there are a few little examples that I think are fun to work through and in fact I think it's a good idea for you to try them on your own and then in a different video I'll post the solutions so let me scroll down I've written these out already so these are three problems that I think are very nice to try so this first problem is to show that the complete bipartite graph which has one part I'd set on M vertices and the other part I'd set has n vertices show that it's Hamiltonian if and only if the two part I'd sets have the same number of vertices which is at least two so and then the second problem is to give an example of a graph which has no Hamilton path so let alone having a Hamilton cycle now the third problem is similar to what we discussed we said that we have if we have a Hamilton cycle we can remove one of the edges so we have some Hamilton cycle and then this might be like the last edge right here if we remove it we're left with a Hamilton path can the reverse be done can a Hamilton path always be used to form a Hamilton cycle please explain your answer so if you think yes then explain why give a proof for why and if you think no then give an example of a graph which actually has a Hamilton path but does not have a Hamilton cycle and so those three problems are fairly straightforward and I'll provide the solutions in another video
