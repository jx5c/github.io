all right I just want to show some quick examples of symmetric and asymmetric encryption and I'm going to use a couple websites and talk about what they're utilizing for your secure connection generally when you connect to a secure website you connect in an asymmetric format and then the session data is sent in a symmetric format as far as the encryption goes so let's show this now the first website is PayPal and what I'm going to do is I'm going to click on the green area here right on the padlock and we're gonna go to connection it'll take a look at that for a second now I'm using the Chrome browser right now but this method will work the same way or similar to this way on other browsers like Firefox and Internet Explorer and Safari and what have you you click up here in the green area or where the padlock is so if we look at the connection we see that the identity of PayPal has been verified by Verisign and Verisign is a common company to use for certificates when you make an HTTPS connection you gotta use some type of certificate and we see other information here which we'll talk about in just a minute remember that we start with an asymmetric key exchange we're using HTTPS and that's the standard if you're going to connect to a website where there's a secure connection for some reason you might be just locking into the site or you might be dealing with a banking institution or institution like PayPal that primarily deals with money if it's the latter you better hope that the website uses the best encryption possible so HTTPS is going to rely on a secure connection mechanism such as TLS or SSL TLS is preferable and in this case we see down here the connection is using TLS 1.2 now that's not the real encryption being used we want to know exactly what's you being utilized to make the key exchange down here we can see it's RSA and we want to know what the encryption is being used when we actually send session data we can see here that's AES 256-bit we can find out more information about this certificate that we've gotten from Verisign by clicking on certificate information and going to details and if we scroll down here we'll see that the public key used during the key exchange is RSA RSA is an asymmetric algorithm and we're using the most really the most powerful algorithm that RSA recommends which is 2048 bits so that's excellent we're signing the algorithm with the sha-1 hashing or cryptographic hashing algorithm and we don't know exactly what the bit strength of that it is but for sha-1 I'm going to assume it's 160 we could find that out but I'm gonna assume that's what it is well okay this and I'll go back for a second so we know that RSA is being used for the key exchange so that's the initial connection and then once that's running we move over to symmetric encryption for once the login is finished we'll move over to symmetric encryption which is done by a AES 256-bit very powerful not known as anything that's not known as crackable and pretty much the one of the best block ciphers that you can use for symmetric transfer of encrypted data let's take a look at another website and we'll go to Amazon and this is the Amazon sign-in page now if we click on the padlock for this and go to connection we'll see a little bit more again a Verisign certificates being used but this time the HTTPS connection is TLS 1.0 we are using RSA if we go to the certificate information again details we'll see it's the same it's 2048 bits and once again we're using sha-1 for the hash and that's very common on most websites but the difference again instead of 1.2 we're using TLS 1.0 and finally for the data session that's using the symmetric cipher RC for 128-bit and it's interesting to see this because some companies have recommended that you don't use this anymore including Microsoft for example for Remote Desktop Services so it's interesting to see this it's something to keep in mind but this is wrapped with the RSA exchange mechanism at 2048 bit again is is anybody gonna try to grab your information as you're sending it back and forth on Amazon and as a man-in-the-middle attack and try to decrypt that it's pretty unlikely and it's also unlikely that they'll be able to crack this but there is the possibility so a company like PayPal or your bank or something of that nature they should use AES at least 128 and better yet 256 bit and the latest TLS possible so check out your own banking institution and see what it uses when you connect online you could find out some very important things also you know check out things like you know what's the minimum password length or excuse me what's the maximum password length that you can do when you connect to your bank a lot of banks they don't go very high they go like 12 characters max so you got to watch out for those types of things if you do have a limited length on your password with your banking institution online you better use some complexity so anyways let's go to a third website and actually just to review RSA is the asymmetric algorithm that's the key exchange mechanism that happens first and AES is the symmetric algorithm which is used for the rest of the data session if we go to the NSA website we see some information here sweet B cryptography it's a whole group of protocols that the government will use to secure information on the secret level and you know one of the things they use here is AES on the symmetric side for sending a data with either key size of 128 or 256 neither of these have been cracked and oftentimes it's not the you know it's not the protocol that gets cracked it's the implementation of the protocol or the protocol is circumvented somehow for key exchange you know the general encryption going back to this the general encryption that's gonna be symmetric and quite often AES the key exchange that initiates all this is going to be asymmetric most of the time RSA is very common here we're not using that we're using diffie-hellman but in a elliptic curve format and that's known as EC D H if you're doing it in in ephemeral mode that would also be known as EC D H E and it shows the length of the curves that are being used as far as the bit length 256 or 384 compare that to PayPal that uses RSA with 2048 bits you need a lot more computational power to do that key exchange with RSA than you do with an elliptic curve with diffie-hellman or an elliptic curve with DSA because the bit length is much less and finally they're using sha as well and that's going to be either 256 or 384 so pretty powerful stuff this is in order to get access to secret clearance files all of these things have to be met all these different algorithms have to be met so you've got your symmetric you've got your asymmetric and you've got your cryptographic hash so that's a little bit about asymmetric and symmetric algorithms take a look at some websites look at the pad and check out the certificate information and the encryption used
