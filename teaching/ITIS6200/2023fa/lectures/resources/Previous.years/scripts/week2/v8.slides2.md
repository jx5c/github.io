good morning and welcome back to the 62 180 200 class and then in the early seventies the asymmetric encryption algorithm appear now I have two keys the public and private key in public key is public and private key or keep it to yourself and the private key cannot be derived from the public key it is like a one like we introduced in the previous video it's like a one directional pipe okay so if you drop something from this side it can only be open from the other side and the vice versa and vice versa it's a very strong scalable and easy for broadcast and multicast but a relatively slow so what do we mean so now again let's look at this we have a B and C ok so now Alice will have to key one is public Alice one is private Alice and of course Alice could deliver the public Alice to everyone who she want to communicate so now when Alice encrypt a message with the private key of Alice and send it out everybody who has a public key who have the corresponding public key will be able to open the message and then recover the message so now let's see how many keys do we need to generate while we have em people everybody need only two keys one public key one private key so altogether you only have to and keys and if you recall to N is a treat straight line this is N and this is to it ok it's very straight line so it will increase linearly at the same time where you need to stand out a copy to multiple people you just need to encrypt the ones which is very very good and it reduced overhead avoided the actual encryption computation and its toll on and so forth the only problem however is that it's relatively slow ok in this slide we illustrate a different type of attack to encryption system you have ciphertext only attack which basically means I only see the encryption result I have no knowledge at all about what's inside ok and of course for this type of attack the amount of ciphertext that you√≠ve drop matters for example I got to remember to change it to the writing style you have Alice and Bob ok they have a shared secret and there is a message that inc repeat it and of course here you have an eavesdropper the eavesdropper will keep an eye on the communication channel and whenever Alice sent out a message if drop her we look at a copy and you can imagine the more ciphertext that the eavesdropper get the better chance that she will compromise the encryption procedure and get the kab so that's why we say that actually the amount of traffic matters and actually under many conditions the security mechanism try to reduce the amount of traffic that is encrypted by the same key the second type is the known plaintext attack which basically means you know the cipher text and the does the plaintext only thing you want figure out is the key for example ok for the known plaintext attack what we're discussing is like we know the M and we know the e km the only thing is we try to figure out what is the corresponding K ok and you can still imagine there are different ways to do this and obviously this known plaintext attack is a little bit more in the favor of the bad guy because in the first type ciphertext attack only thing you see is this now you have a pair of message and you know this is clear hex and this is the corresponding encryption at least you have one way to verify it the last type is even more in the favor of the bad guy which is the totem plaintext attack which basically means oh I have a so let's say let's give an example ok what is the totem plaintext attack which basically means the bad guy has unlimited access to the encryption without a different message ok so let's say this is an so let's say this is an encryption machine this is an encryption machine you put a plaintext agin it will give you the corresponding ciphertext but this encryption machine is manufactured in such a way that there is a bump in it okay there's a bump in it if you try to open it up and see how it works it will each plot destroy everything so what's your best approach I'm going to feed different the type of plaintext look at the corresponding ciphertext what I'm trying to figure out I'm trying to figure out the key and trying to figure out key so this thing will only do encryption it will not do decryption for you for example you have this machine and then you got a message that your enemies sent out so you'll see a separate txt we see we know it's see what what you are after you want to figure out what is corresponding m12 the c1 okay but you only have an encryption machine you don't have a decryption machine of course you could say oh I'm going to try all possible messages and then I will only compare see the problem is is if this message is very long you will have a huge number of possible messages and you will never finish so the best approach is still using different plane tags in the ciphertext pair try to figure out the key because if you know what is the key you will be able to decrypt okay so this is the totem plaintext attack which is more in the favor of the bad back so in this slide we're asking one question is can you always break any encryption algorithm unfortunately there's one at least one encryption algorithm which is proven to be one hundred percent of secure which it's unbreakable which is the ant I'm a one-time pad we have introduced in the previous video which is basically means you have a randomly generated real randomly generated beaded sequins they never repeat itself and can do an X or with the message will try to encrypt and there's no one can compromise it and another in addition to this absolutely secure proof fully secure Mac Needham like a one-time pad there is some mac Needham that are impossible to break impractical ward actually if you have finished homework one you note he said if you have a 128-bit key and if the best way to compromise it is to try every possible key then we're dealing with something that is impossible to finish there are several traditional I encryption techniques actually the encryption Mac needham today most of time is actually build upon this basic techniques we have substitution ciphers which is basically means replace a character in the plain text with another character for example let us give you an example of substitution cipher you are replacing one character with another for example we say in the Caesar cipher every character will be replaced by the certain character after it for example AE will be replaced by the third line for a period in the alphabet which will become D and B will become a salon so forth in this way if you are saying if you send out a message that I can it will become I tried jkl CT DF v n o P Q so I can will be replaced by message is l f DQ each leg each letter is it's replaced by the Serta ladder after it in the alphabet this is a very simple example of substitution cipher what about the transposition cipher transposition cipher is basically means you shuffle the order for example so let's encrypt this it will become so let's make a very simple transportation cipher you can see what we're doing is we are moving the last letter of every word to the first letter and then why write it as it is ok so the love we're going to become ill of you will be you yah ok if you have watched the sitcom of everybody loved women women actually when he was very young right a dairy about his mom but one sentence said I hate my mom and he actually his IE had ym mom ok and his mom Murray it's it's very mad about this problem ok so this is an example of transposition cipher so in the next slides set of slides were going to introduce this several building blocks of our security mechanisms there are hundreds of security mechanisms in the protocols and fortunately for us only a number limiting the number of building blocks are involved so that's why we only needed to learn those limited building blocks and also the way to put them together to construct a larger larger size more complicated system ok so the first block we're going to introduce it it's about may function this is actually a very large topic we probably cannot finish introducing it in one set of video we probably need to go through multiple rounds ok the one day function is basically saying it's easy to calculate in one direction but not the other so many of you know a hash function is a when they function but let's say generically let's say we're not talking about a hash function we're just talking about a general when they function which is f ok so this F is a one-way function so if I give you x it's very easy to calculate FX on the contrary if I give you only FX it's very very difficult to build to find an x such that FX equal to this ok this is a one-way function there are several real life examples of ghulam a function a hash function is definitely one but we're going to save it for future but let's look at one example here ok here we show we giving them home which is think about the fingerprint of a person ok the let's say the function f is to get them but its fingerprint so if i give you a person it's very easy to get hit or her fingerprint you take to put his or her finger into the ink and then put the finger on the paper you got a fingerprint on the contrary if I only give you the fingerprint could you reboot or reconstruct a person for me if you do not have the FBI's database I just give you a fingerprint you just look at the fingerprint and see hmm this this person is a white male in his 40s driving a Ford f-150 can do that it probably could not this is a very good example of one may function and we didn't want a function there's a one sub category which is called a trap door one day function it's a little bit different from traditional any function it's basically great I give you X is very easy to calculate F X if i give u FX it's very difficult to get x however if i give you FX and a secret why it will be very easy to recover x actually a symmetric encryption is like this trap door when they function so what do we mean so let's look at this okay remember the asymmetric encryption algorithm evolved to Messrs when is the public key sorry and why is the private key okay so I give you a message it's very easy to encrypt the message with the public key okay however if I only give you this it's very hard for you to guess what is the corresponding message unless I give you a secret which is the private key yes if you have the private key you can decrypt the result of the encryption of the message with the public key and the vom so that's why we say asymmetric encryption rhythm is actually a good example of trap door Monday function
