hi welcome to this lecture on symmetric key cryptography so you may recall the symmetric key or secret key cryptography is a cryptographic technique where both parties in the communication share the same key so in the example we did in a previous lecture we have Alice taking her plain text and encrypting it with a secret key in getting up her ciphertext and then Bob takes that same ciphertext and he decrypts it with the same secret key so those two keys are the same and he gets out the original plaintext that Alice encrypted so that's basically how symmetric key cryptography works there Two Types of Symmetric Crypto are two types of symmetric key cryptography stream ciphers and block ciphers and we're going to talk about both of those in this lecture so stream ciphers are a type of symmetric key crypto and they use a fixed length key to produce what's called a pseudo-random stream of bits and what that means is you put in a fixed length key and this algorithm just produces a string of ones and zeros seemingly random but anytime you use the same key into the algorithm you get out that same stream of ones and zeros and then in order to encrypt or decrypt you just use the exclusive or operator to exclusive or those bits with your plaintext in order to encrypt and you exclusive are those same bits in order to decrypt so it works the same way other way whether you encrypting or decrypting you're just exclusive oaring your message with the bits from the bit stream the goal of a stream cipher is to approximate a one-time pad so when we discussed a one-time pad I mentioned that it was the only provably secure form of cryptography which is where your key is just as long as your message well a stream cipher has the goal to approximate that but instead of using a key that's as long as a message you use a much smaller key and then that Keys used to generate a very very very long stream of bits so let's look at some two Real-Word Stream Ciphers real-world stream ciphers the first is called RC 4 RC 4 was a stream cipher that's most famously used in WEP the wireless equivalent protocol or wired equivalent protocol for wireless network security it's also an option in TLS or HTTPS for encrypting web traffic but it's not recommended for use anymore it has some mathematical weaknesses that mean it's May it's not suitable for quite a few applications another real-world stream cipher is a 5-1 and this is used for encrypting GSM phone data and conversations and so it's used to encrypt data before your phone sends it wirelessly to the to the operator the NSA is known to routinely break a 5/1 this was released as part of the Snowden leaks so again it's another stream cipher that's not really recommended for for usage so let's do a stream cipher Stream Cipher Encryption Example encryption example so let's say we have some plaintext data that we want to encrypt and we have a key that we're going to use in this case I'll just make it 128 bits we take that key and we feed it into our stream cipher which in this case is our c4 and that causes our c4 to produce key stream which is a potentially infinitely long string of ones and zeros but we produce enough key stream so that we have the same length of key stream as we do plaintext data and then we exclusive-or those two things together in order to get our cipher text so the key stream exclusive board with the plaintext gets me the ciphertext so I could write that as ciphertext equals the key stream exclusive Ord with the plaintext well how do i decrypt decryption is very similar except in this case I have ciphertext that I want to decrypt and I take that same key that was used to encrypt it I put the key into rc4 I get out the same key stream that the person who encrypted got and when I exclusive-or the key stream and the ciphertext together I get the plaintext another way to write that would be to simply say that plaintext equals key stream exclusive Ord with ciphertext so let's look at that a Using XOR with a Stream Cipher little bit more about how we use exclusive or with a stream cipher now when we use exclusive or for encryption we see that the ciphertext equals the plaintext exclusive Ord with the key stream which is just what we went over when we use it for decryption the plaintext equals the cipher text exclusive Ord with the key stream so basically whether you're encrypting or decrypting you simply take the message you're working with and you exclusive-or with the key stream and that performs the encryption or the decryption operation let's look at an example so if XOR Example I'm going to do an encryption now my plaintext is here oh 0 1 1 0 and my key stream is 1 1 0 1 I'm going to exclusive-or them together to get the cipher text now in case you're not familiar with exclusive or are you've forgotten because it's been a long time since you looked at it here's the truth table for exclusive or and what this shows is that if we exclusive or 1 together with 1 we get 0 1 exclusive o'red of 0 is 1 0 exclusive o'red with 1 is 1 and 0 exclusive o'red of 0 is 0 it's just the truth table for exclusive or so if I look here and I see that the plaintext is 0 1 1 0 the key stream is 1 1 0 1 when I do the exclusive or I'm just going to do a bitwise so 0 exclusive o'red with 1 is 1 1 exclusive ward with 1 is 0 so I have 1 0 1 exclusive ward with 0 is 1 and 0 exclusive o'red of 0 is 0 so my ciphertext is 1 0 1 0 if I go to decrypt then so if I decrypt that ciphertext using the exact same key stream then I'm just going to exclusive or those together again so 1 exclusive ward with 1 is 0 0 exclusive o'red with 1 is 1 1 exclusive o'red with 0 is 1 and 0 squared of 0 is 0 so I get that result to be 0 1 1 0 and they match so you can see up here that the original plaintext I started with matches the plaintext I get at the end 1 decrypt so I encrypt by exclusive warring with the key stream and I decrypt by exclusive warring with that same key stream so that was stream Intro to Block Ciphers ciphers now we also want to look at something called block ciphers now block ciphers are another type of symmetric key crypto and what they do is they use a fixed length key to encrypt a fixed length block of data so a stream cipher generated key stream and you exclusive o'red that together a block cipher encrypts specific blocks fixed length chunks of data into the into an ciphertext of the exact same length so for example a 64-bit block of data and a 128-bit key could be the parameters for a block cipher so I could have a block cipher where my key is 128 bits and I encrypt 64 bits of data at a time now at its core a block cipher is in some ways very similar to a substitution cipher but with a much larger alphabet so remember in a substitution cipher we simply had every letter written out as one entry in a table and then we randomly permuted the entries so that the so that the encrypted version was just a randomized list of the alphabet so that meant that every letter in the plaintext had a one-to-one correspondence with a letter in the ciphertext well the block cipher is basically the same thing except our alphabet size is a lot bigger instead of it just being 26 letters it's every possible say 64 bit value so if we were to do a 64 bit block cipher that would mean that our substitution table would have 2 to the 64 entries which is 1.8 times 10 to 19 that's a huge number that would be a really big substitution table in fact it would be a hundred and 25 million terabytes so it's huge so I don't give this example to say that this is how a block cipher works it doesn't build an actual table but the idea is the same in concept every 64 bits of plaintext would have a corresponding cipher text for a given key so my goal of a block cipher is to do this same thing but do it with an algorithm and a small key instead of building up an enormous table Real-World Block Ciphers so some real-world block cyphers will go over two of them the first is the data encryption standard des des is a was a US government standard until 2001 it was released in 1976 and it uses a 64-bit block size in a 56 bit key size so the key was 56 bits but the blocks of data that you encrypt are 64 bits now a DES was replaced by AES the advanced encryption standard an aes uses a 128-bit block size and it can take a variety of key sizes either 128 192 or 256 bits for the key size AES is the current US government standard and it's it's probably the most widely used symmetric key algorithm in in most applications today and it's considered very secure lots of smart people have looked at it and they haven't found any significant weaknesses let's do a Simplified AES Example simplified AES example so in this case my encryption I take some plaintext data of one block size so if we're doing a EES that block size the hutt is 128 bits I take a key which is 256 bits for AES here and I run it through the AES encryption algorithm so the key and the data go in together and that produces ciphertext data of 128 bits so my plaintext block is converted to a ciphertext block of the same size and when I decrypt I do the same thing in Reverse I put my ciphertext and the key into the AES decryption algorithm and I get out the plaintext data now it's really important to note a couple of things here first is that the block size is really important you can't use a block cipher to encrypt something that's smaller or larger than the block size you can only encrypt an item that is exactly that size so if your item is smaller than in this case 128 bits you would need to break it up into pieces and encrypt each piece separately if your item is bigger than the block size in this case 128 bits then you need to break it up into smaller pieces and encrypt each 128-bit piece separately if your item is smaller than 128 bits then you need to add some junk we call it padding just add some extra bits to get it up to the right size because a block cipher only encrypts chunks of data that are the right size blocks so let's look at some properties Properties of Block Ciphers of block ciphers now one important property is that the plaintext two ciphertext mappings must be one-to-one for a given key so that means that for a given key the same plaintext block always becomes the same ciphertext block and the same ciphertext block always becomes the same plaintext block so vice-versa it's also really important that the input and output have no correlation so what this means is if I have a 128-bit input block that will produce an output block if I change one bit of that input block then the output block should change significantly in a way that's not distinguishable from random and not distinguishable from random it's just a big fancy way to say that about 50% of the bit should change so if I change one bit on the input then about 50% of the output bits should change so get some features of block Features of Block Ciphers ciphers the first is the block size in general the bigger the block size the more secure it is to an extent but it's probably slower larger block sizes tend to be a little bit slower when you do the encryption in the decryption and key size is the same in general bigger is more secure but it's probably slower because it takes more computations to do the encryption okay so let's summarize this discussion Summing Up of block ciphers and stream ciphers stream ciphers are used to produce a pseudo-random stream of bits that you exclusive or with your plaintext so the stream cipher produces the stream of bits your ki stream and you exclusive or that with your plaintext to encrypt or you exclusive for it with your ciphertext to decrypt block ciphers are used to encrypt one data block or used to encrypt data one block at a time so you put in one block of plaintext you get out one block of ciphertext and in all of the symmetric key ciphers that we've talked about today the sender and receiver need to share the same key
