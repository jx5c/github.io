good morning and welcome back and in this video we are going to provide some feedback and the commenting on the introduction to the asymmetric encryption algorithm okay first of things first I want to give you some real-life examples to explain the difference between symmetric encryption and asymmetric encryption cementery encryption is more like this you have a key and I have a key for example we have an room we have a room and the room has a lock and you have the key to open the lock I have the key to open the lock so you can open the room put something in it in the room and then you lock the room and since I have the key I will be able to open the room later enter the room and see what you left in this office so that's like symmetric encryption both you and I we have the same key we have the same key and you can use the key to encrypt the message and you can I can use the very same key to decrypt a message what is a real-life example of this public/private key encryption algorithm the public private key encryption algorithm is more like a one directional pipe one directional pipe for example I will give two example okay let's say you rent a car from Avis or Enterprise and when you need to return the car their office is closed so you drive back to the renting office it's 9:00 p.m. nobody if there're nobody sir so what do they expect you to do there is always a job box on the door of the office and you are supposed to feel that renting document how many miles you drive if the oil tank funa blah blah blah you'll feel everything and you sign and you wrap the car key with this renting document and you'll slide it through the top box through the top box this is like you are encrypting with the public key of the Avs renting office okay you are going to drop the massive in the job box and who can open it and who can see the message the store manager who have the key to the other side of the jaw box to the other side of the top box the next morning he or she will come and use that key to open the top box and we'll see five sets of car keys and five sets of renting documents who come in late and return all the vehicles okay so that's like your encrypted with the public key and that the manager will open with the private key okay we can guarantee you that only the owner of the private key will be able to open the other side only the store manager will be able to open the other side and actually see what you drop in this drop box okay and similarly consider the post office so when you want mails mail a mail to some other people you can drop it and only the postman will be able to open the box from the other side and see what are the Mail's for okay and we want to emphasize one thing here so the asymmetric encryption of public private key encryption they only provide a mechanism to encrypt a message okay we do not guarantee the value of the message for example okay this is an extreme case I don't want you to do anything that I'm going to describe later okay so let's say and the avis Car Rental office so the good people will put it a document and the car key together and the chopped car keys in the top box so this is what you are supposed to do there on what you're supposed to do so let's say I'm really a bad guy I have a paper cup I'm drinking coke and after I finished my cup of coke and said where should I dump my paper cup ah okay Aires has a Dropbox so I folded my paper box and I throw it into the jaw box this is a very bad thing this is just alike you generated some garbage message and you encrypt with the public key of Bob any of San - Bob okay even under this extreme case we can still guarantee because of the asymmetric encryption algorithms properties only Bob will be able to open it in other words the next morning the store manager will open the Dropbox and he will see four car keys and a garbage paper box okay nothing can prevent us from encrypt some garbage message and send it to the receiver but a cementery encryption can guarantee you that steal only the owner of the private key will be able to see that garbage message okay we won't emphasize this in this slice the presenter Illustrated two ways of using this asymmetric encryption algorithm your users encrypted with the public key sent to the owner of the private key and this message will only be able to be opened by the owner of the private key or you can use it in the reverse direction which the owner of the private key will encrypt a message which for private key and send to everybody else whoever has a copy of the public key will be able to open it and obviously when you use them in different ways they serve different purpose the top case actually achieved confidentiality which basically means okay nobody can see what I'm sending to Alice other Alice okay whether or not I send her a good message some garbage or I just send some inappropriate material that's between me and Alice nobody else will be able to figure it out at the bottom case is it's more like an integrity or a verification usage okay whoever whoever has a copy of the public key of Alice will be able to verify that okay this message is signed by Alice not anybody else this message is originated from Alice they serve different purpose actually in later part in this video the presenter actually leave any question open which is okay if Alice and about want to communicate and they want to achieve both things they want to achieve both confidentiality and the integrity or verification in other words we want to achieve both Bob can verify it is from Alice but not very anyhow at the same time Alice can guarantee that okay only Bob can open it nobody else what are we going to do of course we need to do double encryption okay and of course when we talk about double encryption there is an order we need to consider should we digitize ein first and then encrypt or do we encrypt and then sign it's different it will serve different security levels so we're going to discuss it about it later okay in this slides the presenter is basically saying the AES encryption with 128-bit key can do 100 megabytes per second calculation encryption and RSA 1024 can do only one megabits backbite per second so roughly a symmetric encryption algorithm it's a hundred times slower okay I have to remind you about one thing in our homework one we actually contains such a question and I believe most of you finally in week okay a 128-bit key in a es it roughly has the same level of security as RSA with three thousand a 72 bits key okay so in this video when he said that is 128 when he compared ES 128 and RSA 10.4 we're actually comparing two algorithm with different levels of security okay if you really want to compare the two types of algorithm with the similar security you need to compare AES 128 with RSA with 3000 instantly two-bit key that's why most of the cases and they're multi cases we're still seeing a cementery encryption algorithm is roughly a thousand times slower than symmetric encryption algorithm okay I just want to make this clear in this slides the presenter introduced what the bad guy can do so if you look at this message the message is only encrypted by the public key of Bob and the who can do this calculation whoever has the public key of Bob will be able to generate a such a message will be able to generate such method there is no integrity verification whatsoever provided by the public key so that basically means okay Bob's public key provide a communication channel to Bob and whoever wants to throw some curveballs to Bob he or she can do that where we can only make sure that only Bob will we say that both but we cannot verify who is the thrower of the bomb okay and in our homework we actually have a question okay for example let's look at this message it's a ciphertext evil the ciphertext evil the separate hack the evil you are using the public key of Bob and to encrypt there's a message coming from evil so let me ask you this if we put the identity of the sender here in the encrypted a message but before the message before the message will that make the message a secure in other words let's look at this if we are sending out you are encrypting with the public key of Bob and when we encrypt you need to put in your ID for example this is Alice and this is my message to you if this is the way we're sending out message will this guaranteed authenticity of the message in other words can be verify that this message is from Alice but not anybody else can we do that please think about it and we're gonna discuss as you know in this slice the presenter actually mentioned that the hash hash a very big topic that we need to discuss in our 6,200 class actually if you look at it under many conditions hash serve a more important purpose than the symmetric or asymmetric encryption so you're going to see captioning or next video so you're going to be fine okay so in this slides the presenter mentioned that ok the safety of RSA depends on the difficulty to factor a number to the two prime number that generate a product for example we know that if you want to factor 21 you need to factor it into 3 times 7 in the both 3 & 7 there are prime numbers you can affect or more you may think that Wow let's see interesting because how difficult is that how difficult is that if you recall in the previous week when we introduced this RSA or when we introduced this asymmetric encryption algorithm we're actually saying that ok if we are talking about RSA 1024 we're saying we are getting 2 prime numbers both of which are 1024 bits long that's a huge number that's a huge number you could say that okay um factor is not hard because I can just write AC program and I'm going to just start at the factor for example let's do this okay for we have integer I if I'm writing a C code do you have ent dry so for I equals to 1 and I smaller than or equal to n I plus plus and well then I said if if n is multiple if n is multiple of I we factor it else by next I okay of course we should not start from one because and it's always multiple one so we can start from - okay isn't that simple right I just a generate AC program total loop and I try to try to divide the number M by every number smaller than n wouldn't that be good enough for me to factor I agree with you that yes theoretically you can do that but if you have done homework - okay well you're gonna see it in homework 2 to try every possible value with a 128-bit key it will take all the live not only of the human being but also the lifetime of the Sun so there's no way you can finish it before the earth explode okay and then not to mention you're trying every possible of this 100 1,024 bits number okay and we can actually use latter number to make it impossible for you to try every possible values in it so in this way if the most efficient way of factoring numbers is to try every number smaller than it then we're doomed then then RSA will be perfectly safe so basically whether or not RSA is safe is we are investigating whether or not we have a more efficient way to factor it if we do then RSA is no longer secure and we can no longer use it for those most important thing and if we cannot find a very fish in the way of compromising RSA compromising the factoring problem then we are still good we're still good
