ood morning everyone and welcome back to 6200 8200 so you did this week you can see we post a lot of materials related to access control and I do receive a few questions during the office hour and I want to clarify a few things so we are not going to extensively discuss any sub success control model but we are going to clarify a few things okay the first thing we want to clarify is about the discretionary access control and you can see on the screen we have that discretionary access control and the mandatory access control okay the difference between the two things the two access model it's pretty interesting so the discretionary based access control very frequently the DAC the discretionary based access control very frequently they are considered as owner controlled access and the mandatory access control very frequently are considered as system based or system controlled access I will give you a few examples and you understand okay so for example I write a document so Alice write a document and we call it add okay okay and because Alice it's the owner of the document and if we are using DAC discretionary access control Alice will have full control to determine who can do what about the document or whether or not he will give other person's permission to read or write or edit the document for example Alice can give Bob only the reading permission and but Alice can give Carol reading and the writing permission okay because palaces the owner Alex can determine all the things okay so there's one thing about the discretionary access control since its owner based remember the owner doesn't mean it's the creator a owner does not mean it is creator for example Alice generated the document a and Alice mock makes a photocopy of the document makes a photocopy of the document and a give it to David okay and then Alice's said hey David this is a copy for you so now we have two copies of the document a one copy held by Alice the other copy held by David so David now has a file also document a we call the Duncan document a prime because this is a photocopy of the original fire remember now David becomes the owner of the document da prime which basically means David will have the freedom to redistribute the file because he is the owner and he has the permission to give other person's read write or execute permissions on this copy of the original file because he is the owner okay you could say that Alice is the original creator of the file I agree with you unfortunately in da see if a copy got transferred and the owner become and the owner of the copy becomes another person then that person will have the full control over the redistribution of course under some cases this is not a very attractive property okay that's why there are creator based creator based access control which basically means hey who is G or need to know creator of the file will always have the control over it what is the real-life example of this type of creator based access control if you have ever worked with some company and the company will show you some document or some data very frequently the company and you the company will force you to sign something called a nondisclosure agreement NDA so then disclosure agreement which basically means hey whatever I tell you now you will know the information even if I keep your copy okay you do not have the freedom to redistribute the information to other person without my knowledge and without my permission so this is a nondisclosure agreement so this is a very good example of creator based access control which the original owner always control the distribution of the file even if you know the file you do not have the freedom to redistribute it okay so this is basic some difference between the discretionary access control and the creator access control so what about mandatory access control what do we mean that mandatory access control is a system based approach or in other words its system controlled access so let's say every one of us every one of us if you have a driver's license and you know that you have a driver's record or report so actually if you are ever involved in some traffic accident and a frequently the company or even you know sometimes the court want you to surrender a copy of your driving record to the court so you know you have the record okay so let's say one day you are driving too fast on the road I apologize I never learn to draw nicely okay so let's say you're driving way too fast on the road and what will happen yeah we've got to pull over by a police car okay no problem there's a police car flashing the light right behind you and if you have been united long enough you will notice that as soon as you stopped and the police car stopped behind you the police officer will not immediately get out of his or her car in approaching you why because the police officer the police officer is actually pulling out all the record related to the car related to the owner of the car because the police officer wants to know hey is this car reported as stolen inside a stolen car and who is the owner of the car registered that the owner have any while in the record the record of attacking the police officer that he or she I mean the owner of the car oh and weapon illegally all this will determine how the police officer handled the case okay if it's a very dangerous case you will notice that the police officer approach you very carefully and on full alert okay so why are we talking about this case this is a good example of mandatory access control which is the system determines who can accept the file in this sub P sub cific example your driving record is the file and that system is basically the law enforcement system determined that yes the police officer will be allowed to read your file and the police officer does not need your permission does not need your permission also this driving record is about you not about anybody else to access the file and the see whether or not there is a danger involved okay so I believe this is a very good example of DAC and ma C mandatory access control okay this is the first thing we want to clarify the second thing we want to clarify is about the access control matrix access control matrix and sometimes we call it a role based access control okay so we have actually have a few videos we posted it related to robotics as control and you can see the role based access control has many advantage compared to several other access control method and here we are going to illustrate one more advantage which is the excess efficiency okay so what do we mean by excess efficiency let's consider one case okay to compare the access control matrix and the role based access control so let's say we have a company that has 600 employees well this is a pretty large company okay and of course the company will determine the level of the employees based on their experience skills contributions to the company solo and so forth so let's say they divide the employees into twelve levels well there are quite a few companies in the IT field yields similar management style for example if you're a Microsoft if you're freshly graduated and the graduated kids and very frequently they will give you the level 57 or 58 and if you become you know when you'll reach get promoted to the level of 59 or 60 you can become a problem Project Lead you can lead a group of four or five people and if you are reaching get to the 70 level you that means you're a big guy in the company at least from the technical wise you're a big group ok so you get the idea so let's say we have 12 levels of the employees and the XS is based on the levels so if you are at this level you will be allowed to access all the files associated with this level or lower levels for example if you are level 60 then you can read all the files with the clearance of 57 58 59 and a 60 but you cannot read up okay and then let's say well without losing generality let's say we have 1 million files well surprisingly if you look at your computer you will see that well you probably have more than 1 million files your computer but anyway so if we do this in access control matrix what are we going to see we're going to build a huge matrix with 600 rows why because we need a one employee for one row for every employee we're gonna have one row and then how many columns do we have of course we have 1 million columns why because we have 1 million files and we want to see for each file who can do what operation so now you're going to see a huge matrix huge matrix with 600 routes and the 1 million columns and of course in which in each entry in the matrix you're either gonna have either read or write or execute or nothing or just a read you know so on so forth so basically what type of matrix are we talking about we are talking about a matrix with 600 rows times 1 million columns so we are talking about a matrix with 600 million ok 600 million of what it could be a byte it could be multiple bits it depends on how complex your data's structure is but still you need a 600 million entries now let's see what happened to the row based access control we know that the employees are classified into 12 rows 12 levels so we first build a matrix that will map between the 600 employees and the 12th levels so basically for every employee it has a role okay and then we have 12 columns and one of them will have the value of one or the other will have the value of zero this is fifty-seven level 58 59 so if this guy is 59 level this is what all the remaining levels are what are zeros okay so now we have one matrix to determine who belongs to what level how large is this matrix it's 600 rows times 12 which is 7200 okay this is a very small matrix and then we're going to generate another huge matrix and this matrix still has 1 million columns because we have 1 million files and how many rows do we have here yes you're right we have only 12 rows why because we only got 12 levels ok so again we have all this on trace and in each country you will be able to write either read or write or execute so on and so forth that basically means hey if you are at this level you will be able to do read write execute operation on this file mmm that looks very similar to the access control matrix there's only one difference which is this matrix is much smaller how big is this matrix of course twelve million so what is the total storage requirement of the row based access control approach you need a 70-200 plus 12 million and since this thing is so small compared to 12 million we can just ignore it we're roughly equal to 12 million okay compared to the direct access control matrix what do we achieve we achieve 50 times reduction in storage this is a huge benefit this is a huge benefit imagine your file every of your file will shrink by the factor of 50 you will never almost never finish using your heart at life and imagine if you download a height if you are watching a high-definition movie from YouTube and the bandwidth requirement is only 2% 1 in 50 you will be able to watch very high quality movies so so how do we achieve this the reason we achieve this is we first a map a pretty large number 600 to 12 and then we map the level to the access control privileged access privilege okay so basically the 50 times fold actually comes from here comes from here does that mean we do not have any cost of course we have some cost the cost is said if you want to decide whether or not Alice can access file 5 well I'm sorry file 2 in the ACM based approach how many times of memory access do you need you only need 1 by because you only need to find Alice in here and you need to find file 2 in here and you look at the cross that is your entry so you only need to read the memory for once what about the second approach how can you determine what operation can Alice conduct on the file f 2 you need due to memory access the first Americas will determine what is Alice's row and then the second access will determine Alice's operation privilege over the file F 2 so basically you are doubling you are doubling the excess delay to get the 50 times fold of storage rate duction you will say well do I really want this double the delay well it depends okay the modern system will give you a very short of memory except delay let's say it's one millisecond it's one millisecond so let's say let's double it is two milliseconds so what is two milliseconds is two divided by 1,000 a second okay it's almost impossible for you to notice the difference between one milliseconds and a two milliseconds if we can achieve this level of difference that basically means from the user experience point of view there's no difference but at the same time we drastically reduce the overhead in the computer system which will provide you a lot of benefit okay I hope you feel that it helps you to clarify a few things in the access control okay and I will be happy to talk to you in the next video thanks bye
