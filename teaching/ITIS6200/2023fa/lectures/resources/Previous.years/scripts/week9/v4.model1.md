good morning everyone and welcome back to ideas 62 180 200 and we are going through these cards two things one is this barrel a popular model and the other is as Chinese war model but before we go there let's first refresh your memory with some of the basic concepts okay so in the video they actually introduced two things which is mandatory access control the other is discretionary based access control that these questioner basics has controls basically the user have the capability to determine user determines who can read or write what okay for example Alice create file1 and Alice since Alice created file 1 Alice will be able to share the file with Bob and the Bob can read file 1 and the Cassie can read or write file 1 okay and that these crushed very basics has control it's basically we only look at the users identity and decide what they can do and one important thing is that for example Elias created a file 1 if Alice give a copy of file 1 to Bob Bob will become the owner of the file and the Baba will be able to decide whether or not to share this copy of the file with other people and he does not have to get the permission from Alice this is quite different from some application scenarios we're going to introduce later so be very very careful in the discretionary based access control if you give a copy of the file to another person you'll lose the control of that copy he or she will be able to decide ok and the mandatory consents control a very good example of this mandatory access control is the system decide what can what the system will decide what a user can do what files the system and decide what a user can do ok or whether or not he or she has the access to the files and the user cannot decide that it's all based on a system for example a very good example is if you got put pulled over by office by a police car okay you can imagine your car registration your insurance policy and your driving history all those files belong to you right because that's your file okay however the police officer will get the permission from the system in this case from the government or some other authorities to directly access your file in other words the police officer does not need your permission to pull your record so they the office are looking at your car plate will see who you are who they've got who does this car belong to whether or not there's a criminal record associated with the car it's as a stolen car all those and your driver record okay all those the officer will automatically get the permission to to poo out of the file and the look at them you don't even have a say you cannot tell the officer said oh I don't give you the permission to see my record file you do not have this chance so under that case this is a very good example of a mandatory access control okay so before we actually introduce this fella popular model we are going to introduce refresh your memory a little bit okay and now let's go back to this Bella popular module and in the video they actually introduced us we introduced this model if we use one sentence to describe this model is basically no read of and no write down okay so the basic idea is to prevent the the basic goal the basic goal is to prevent a subject basically whether it's a subject it's a person with low clearance from reading the object of a high classification so what do we mean so basically here every user will have a clearance and every file will have a corresponding classified level ok so most of time we here we give a very simple example let's say we have the top secret this is the highest level and if you could also have the level of secret you could also have the clearance of classified or maybe it's public or unclassified ok so on the left hand side let's say we have user on the right side we have the file so let's say we have file 1 this is secret level and we have the user Alice the Alice has a clearance of top secret okay well look at this for level of clearance from high to low you have top secret secret classified in public so top secret and it's higher than secret so Alice will be able to read a file 1 let's see let's say another user Bob have the clearance of secret and the file 1 also have the clearance that the classified level of secret so Baba will be able to read it a file let's say we have a user C which is only have the clearance of classified ok classified is lower than the level of secret so C will not be allowed to read it a file because the file contains the information that is higher than the education of the user sea of the other states OC will not be allowed to read this file okay so this is a very simple example but let's go back okay so one sentence describe to describe the Bella part of the model is no read up and then no write down so we just introduce no read up so if you have a person at the security level here and if you have a file has a security level here and the file has a higher clearance level then the then the user then you cannot read you cannot read why because this is a higher level security level you have a lower clearance so for example we as a general public probably have the lowest clearance level and we are not going to be allowed to read the nuclear bomb launching code from the from the country which has a very high security level okay so the simple this is a very simple type of confidentiality classification so we will you try to maintain the confidentiality of the information and a person a subject has a security clearance and the object has a security classification okay and Isabella popular module combined Monday Torre and the discretionary access control if you recall the mandatory access control is enforced by the system but a discretionary based access control is provided based on the user what do we mean so the barrel of popular model model actually contains two rules the first is simple security rule it says a person s can read a file if and only if the classification of the file is not higher than the clearance of s and as has the discretionary read access to all so you can see if a person s can read a file oh you need to satisfy two conditions the first is the classification of oh is not higher than the clearance of s in other words you can read down or you can read at the same level but you cannot read to a higher level because under this case the file has a higher level than you this is definitely not allowed okay and there is a second requirement which is the person s has the discretionary read access so here Alice has the top secret clearance level and the file is only secret so if you only look at their clearance level in the classification Alice is allowed to read the file however we all know that in the military in the military background or in the military applications there is a very important feature which is called a needed to know okay so you may have a very high clearance level the file may have a relatively low clearance level but if you do not have to know you don't need to know this content you will not be grunt you will not be grunted at the access permission okay so that's why here you can see we have two requirement one is a person needed to have at least the same level of security clearance or higher at the same time you have that these question area access permission to actually do it okay so now let's look at the second requirement second the property so here if you if you look at this here only define whether or not you can read what about right what about right so here we have a star property we have a star property it said
