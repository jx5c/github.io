in this lecture I'm going to discuss access controls now this is something that we've already discussed in the linux administration course and i showed you an example of how you change permissions and ownership for various files using something called discretionary access control but we're going to go into more in depth in this lecture to discover other types of access controls so again an access control is a process to determine who does what to what based upon a policy and we've already discussed security policies these things that need to be worked out by organizations prior to them being implemented so essentially access control is who gets in and out of a system who uses what resources win and in quat amounts you can think about it that's a lot more complicated than what we discussed in the linux administration course and it'll make a lot more sense when you see that access control is not just something that simple where it doesn't necessarily need to be that simple so elements of access control consist of Elements the following four things there are subjects objects operations and something called a reference monitor which I didn't discuss previously now we already think about subjects are going to be the users as we discussed an in Linux administration so what are objects well objects pertain to something just as simple as files but that could be other types of resources such as getting access to the printing server or getting access to a database operations indicate the ability of a subject to either access or not be able to access an object or even a subject accessing an object by a time or place or something of that nature and then we have something called the reference monitor and I will discuss that in a couple of slides and a little more explicit detail but just as an example let's say we have Example a company XYZ and it has four employee employees ow the accountant Bob is the IT guy Mary is the CEO and Fred is the web designer now in this very simple example there are various resources a company has such as a financial database and external web server and an email server so if we think about controlling access to these resources how would we go about determining whether a let's say Alice what she should have access to as an accountant well if you look at the resources maybe the financial database yeah that kind of makes sense what about the external web server would she need access to that well probably not but regardless her ability to access any of these resources should be defined explicitly in the the access control policy as created by the company how about Bob the IT guy does Bob need to get into the financial database well probably not but certainly you might give him access to the external web server so they can he has at least some control over that who else on that list of employees might we want to be able to access the external web server will certainly Fred let's look at Mary the CEO what should Mary be allowed to access financial database maybe external web server well we might depends upon her level sophistication and her need to be able to get into the external web server to make changes and yeah sure maybe everybody on the email server giving them as we'll see later on various levels of access to the email server all levels of access aren't the same as we'll see later on but that's essentially what access control does is it allows certain subjects to access certain objects and various levels of detail now getting back to the reference monitor what is a reference monitor we talked about subjects and objects in the previous example notice number four down there we also have an audit trail which is a good idea it's something that will learn and you'll actually see later on when you'll see that it's when someone a subject is accessing an object it's good to have a trail and audit trail or a logging system that indicates it whether that person was able to access the object the reference monitor really ties in everything it looks it it contains those operations and rules as we'll see later that determines whether the subject is able to access the object and how they're able to do it for example when we looked at the linux administration course there are really only three sets of operations that a subject could perform on an object and specifically we were looking at files and what were those well we had read read we had write and we have executed right and we saw that sometimes a certain subject was able to read write and execute on the file and for other files they were only able to for example read that file but they weren't able to write or execute that file so all of that is determined by the author a ssin database which indicates what the let's say I'm just using to determine general rules that allow subject to interact with an object and that reference monitor is a thing that actually applies that to the situation so just to be clear here's the subjects are the system users and groups of users recall from the linux administration courses you could put users in various groups and that's how we were able to allow a number of users to be in a group and then that group was able to access an object and perform operations on it the objects are most typically your files but they could be other resources such as memory printing and scanning and even including other computers on a network an INXS operation again comes in many forms including web access server access memory access and even method calls so let's look at the three access control models we had to Access Control Models discretionary mandatory and role based access control now most of you are most familiar if you're working with Linux windows and the Macintosh with the discretionary access control so Discretionary Access Control discretionary access control is based on the discretion of the data owner and that's what we saw in Linux is that when we created a file we were the owner and so the owner of the creator of that file specifies which subjects have access to that resource if you recall when we were creating files we were changing permissions on the file we could even change ownership of the file and so that's the most simple level of access control and an example of that is an excess control list we've - which we'll talk about in a lot more detail a little later on but suffice to say that that Windows Linux and the Mac and pretty much any UNIX with with one stipulation as we'll see later implements discretionary access control a more Mandatory Access Control complicated form of access control is mandatory access control and that's where the operating system makes the decision as to whether a subject accesses an object based on a security label system so it's the operating system rather than the data owners or creators that allow or disallow granting access to the object and the the best example of this is what we see in the military is where users and data are labeled according to a clearance level for example a confidential secret and top secret which I'm sure you've all or at least a little bit familiar with and then we have rules for access which are configured by the security officer and then enforced by the operating system and what I'm talking about the operating system I'm talking about that not only the operation database that indicates who has access to what but also that reference monitor that looks at the operation date authorization database as well as the classification levels of the subjects and the objects determine whether access can be granted Macs are used for classification and confidentiality is of the utmost importance which the primary example would be the military and generally you don't you don't see mandatory access controls when you buy a commercial system when you go out and you buy a Windows 10 computer or the latest Macintosh is that you have to specifically buy or at least implement mandatory access control for example with trusted seller Solaris or something called a secure enhanced Linux which was created by the National Security Agency and that's actually something that you can download from a website and implement on your Linux system I would suggest that you you do a lot of research on that and read up a lot about it before you do that because it's a good way to lock yourself out so all MAC sensitivity labels mandatory access control systems have a security label and those labels as we saw before at least in the military are confidential secret and top secret and those security labels and the categories are typically defined by an organization in this case the military and there's also is also one more category which goes above and beyond the MAC label and that is whether you have a need to know at a certain label and we'll talk about that in a second the question is if we're talking about the security labels or security designations of confidential secret and top secret if I have a top security clearance can I see all of the projects in the secret level and typically the answer is no is it not only must your security clearance be equivalent to that as designated to the object but also you have to have a reason to access and information you have to have a need-to-know as we see here on the screen we have the three security clearance levels as well as the sensitivity designation of confidential secret and top secret and so let's say as an example we have a list let's say for this example is that you have a confidential security clearance and you need to look at a memo that has been designated as confidential as long as you have a need-to-know you're able to view that memo as another example let's say that an object has been deemed at this with us with a security label of secret and you only have a confidential clearance can you read the secret level memo the answer is no can you read the Read up? NO! top secret level no so in other words notice that you can't read up someone who has a secret level clearance cannot read a top secret memo and it changes to make this a little bit clearer because actually I was trying to combine two separate concepts of what I did was as I pause the video and can I change what you saw on the screen and I'll explain that on the next screen so this so we see that we can't read up so confidential can't read anything secret secret can't read anything top secret even though they might have a need to know for some particular reason does how does it work the other way though what this is indicating that the arrows are here on the left is that somebody who has a top secret clearance can not only really read a top secret memo that can also read a secret memo and also a confidential memo as long as they have a need-to-know now think about producers of objects that is now someone with a confidential a confidential security clearance creates an object somehow and it can and it happens all the time that is later deem secret at the time they don't know that it's that it's going to be classified secret but they they create one that secret and I've known this from personal circumstances not me but with other people so somebody who has a confidential security clearance can they actually create a document that is later deemed secret yes they can so essentially what this is saying is is that you can write up so you can create one that secret or if your secret you can create one that's top-secret or even if your confidential security clearance you can write one that's top-secret but guess what you would no longer be able to read it I'm afraid that's that's a fact I know that sounds weird but that's absolutely true and this is just another graphical depiction of what you see here and this is when we're talking about reading and this also is predicated on the background that these people these little icons here are individuals who have for example here a top-secret clearance this guy right here this lady they can read this resource and actually it's kind of weird the way this is written this almost looks like it's a right but what they're talking about is accessing the server one which is top-secret so this person is top-secret so they can access the top-secret server they can also access this secret secret level server too as well as the classified or confidential server 3 and notice as you move down this hierarchy here is that the secret clearance individual can access the secret and the classified but notice that they can't read up they're not able to read up and a third type of Role-Based Access Control access control is called role based access control and it's also also often called the non-discretionary access control and essentially it's it's creating a set of rules to determine how subjects and objects interact and so users assigned a role and the roles dictate access to a resource rather than a user and it scales much better than discretionary access control because you don't have to continually change the access control list which again I'll talk about shortly or the permissions per user norm you have to remember what permissions are set under new user just make them a certain role for example up here let's go back to this example right here and so so these are the roles here notice there's an account role there's an IT role as the CEO role and a web designer role and previously we identified these users access to these resources or objects down here so what if later on Alice which who shouldn't be able to access the external email server external web server or email server moves to IT but could we how would we change this well we don't want to go in and start changing the permissions on the financial database or the external web server or the email server it's better to set up predefined roles that suggest that there's an accountant role and all accountants who are a member of this role have access to the financial database in the database only but later on if Alice Alice moves on up to be an sa an IT guy I use that in a general sense and we hire somebody called Ted to become an accountant well we don't have to go back and change any of the permissions on any of these objects all we have to do is to put Ted in the accountant role and Alice now no longer has access to the financial database but she does have access to the external web server and maybe even parts of the email server and now ted has access to the financial database and you see how that works much more cleanly and scales better than the discretionary access control and you can see me this with groups and Windows and Linux especially with with LDAP in Active Directory and roles are engineered based on the principle of something called least privileged which you should have read about in another class and in your book and least privileged just means that you should only the users should only have access to stuff than they need to do their job and then actually if you think about it speaks to the need to know idea as well for example here what does tenth need access to well the least privileged should be in order to do his job he needs to be able to access the financial database he doesn't need for his job to be able to access the external web server if he did we could go back and change the role of accountant so that now the accountant could access both the financial database and the external web server if that's what they need to do and so lease privilege is a core concept in information security and it's something that shouldn't be taken lightly let's go back here so the role contains the Roles minimum amount of permissions to instantiate and on Victor to create an object or to manipulate an object a user is assigned to a role that allows him or her to perform only what's required for that role and for nothing else and no single role has given more permission than the same role for another user and that's the whole idea an accountant anyone who's set up in the account role should have the same permissions as every other accountant if you had different levels of accountant let's say an account one person who deals with the various aspects of a company and then you have an accountant too that deals with other aspects those would be two distinct roles and one may be given more permission than the other but everyone within the account in one role would have the same exact permissions and everybody in the account to role would also have the same permissions so when would you use a role based access control one if you don't need centralized access if you don't need something that's copyright copy if you don't need something as complex as mandatory access control and of course if you have high turnover if you're constantly churning and changing jobs in here let me go back here if every six months these people are moving around or they're being fired and you're adding new people rather than looking at a discretion discretionary access model where you're constantly changing permissions here on the on the users and on the objects all you're having to do is put people in different roles you're either putting them in the account role or you're taking them out of the account role ok now let's talk about access control technologies that support what we've discussed before in terms of mask access control models rule-based constrained user interfaces access control matrices access control lists content dependent access control and context notice that there's an in here and there's an X content versus context Rule-based Access Control so rule based access control uses specific rules to indicate what can and cannot transpire between a subject and object that is a simply the logic did you seen in your math classes or your computer science classes if X then Y logic so before subject can access an an object before subject can access an object it must meet a set of predefined rules for example if a user has a proper security clearance and it's between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. then allow access then notice how now our rules are becoming more complicated not only must a person have them for example here the proper clearance they have to have a need to know and now we're setting time limits so that makes a lot of sense for example if if no one is allowed external access from for example an external IP address to a certain database and they're only supposed to be working during the day then instantiating this role here 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. if that's their standard working day and they're coming from the right hand I P address and the company then they would be allowed access otherwise they would be denied however rule based access control doesn't necessarily deal specifically with identity and author so rule based access control is considered a compulsory control because the rules are strictly enforced and not modifiable by the users so if you think about routers and firewalls and firewalls we would look at and a little bit you'll see how we will create rules that set up restrictions to certain objects for example a telnet server or an FTP server what is the source address what is a source port we define rules based on that information to allow or deny access and here's something that if you think Constrained User Interfaces about access control technologies we see all the time for example a constrained user interface we can restrict user access but not allowing them to see certain data or have certain functionality on the computer and this can come in many examples for example views only allow access to certain data that is canned interfaces that only show a user specific information and they hide everything else to which they should not be allowed access we can also give them something called the restricted shell so as in a shell as the terminal as we used in Linux administration and in this course as well so it's like a real shell but only with certain commands that are enabled like Cisco's one that's highly restrictive is the menuing system and we'll see on a separate page here but so now we're talking about a graphical user interface where we can give access to certain objects at varying levels of detail based upon that person's status and the organization and that's all limited by the menu system and we can also have physically constraint interfaces that show only certain keys on a keypad or a touchscreen like an ATM so the difference is here is that there is that users are being physically constrained from accessing that as other viewing or manipulating the objects so if you see something like this what is the user allowed to do on here well it's constrained by the user interface is they have they have drop-down menus where they are allowed to only select for example on these top three lines right here they are allowed to select certain items they're not allowed to select anything else in the same thing down here now we're talking about numerical input and that's constrained as well and and they can either click here or here but this is all constrained by the user interface so this is an Access Control Matrix access control matrix which is a table of subjects and objects indicating what actions individual subjects can take on individual objects so going down in the columns in the first column over here you see the roles administrators owners guest users planners and payers on the top going across this row we have administrative pages tax and plan bill pay public account use and account administration so if we divide this up by rows and columns we get either a capability table or an access control Capability Table list so we make this a little bigger I can so a capability table is bound to the subjects so now we're talking about this first row over here administrators owners guests and so on and it lists what permissions a subject has to each object so it's a row and it's the opposite of an access control list that we'll see shortly so planners have permissions to access tax plan public account use and account administration an access control list now looks and the Access Control List columns now we're talking about lists access control lists what and how subjects may access a certain object so now we're talking about columns so the account use indicates who has access to this resource which would be owners users planners and payers another type of access control technology is the content dependent access control which is determined by the type of data for example email filters that look for specific things like confidential social security number of images and web proxy servers may be content based as well so it's based on the content rather than the particular role of an individual and Context Dependent Access Control context dependent access control reviews a situation then makes a decision on the access now when we're talking about the system right here we're talking about still the reference monitor and a good example of a context dependent system is a firewall for example as we'll see later I know it's not going to make a lot of sense now but there's there's something called a state table which looks to see if there's a session already in place for the system for the connection between a subject and an object and if that if that connection already exists in the state table then all other connections between the object and the subject for that session are loud without going through the firewall rules another example might be allowing access to certain body image if previous web sessions are referenced in the medical data so this was a a Review of Access Control quick overview of access control and so you should be able to identify and define and recognize the following concepts constrain user interfaces something we probably come in contact with every day in access control matrix capability tables and access control lists we put this right here that makes more sense and content dependent access controls and context dependent access control and we also discuss the three access control models which include discretionary access control mandatory access control and role based access control
