good morning everyone and welcome back to the 6280 200 class by now you should have already watched the short introduction so in this segment I will talk about a few things about this semester's course this is more like an extended a welcome to the course okay the first thing I want to discuss about it's about this online education mastered okay we all know that in the past a few years there have been quite a few efforts about education innovation and a war shifting to the online education is a trend but I have to emphasize something okay online education will not automatically solve everything in other words if you do not focus or if you do not pay attention to the materials in the classroom shifting it to the online version will not solve the problem okay the major advantage of online education is that we have recorded the video materials and if you like you can watch it again and again until you fully understand it if you experience any problem you can come to my office hour or you can send me e-mail or you can use the online discussion forum to raise the questions and get answers not only from me from the TA but also from other students so this is the major advantage of course there are some disadvantages for example it's relatively hard for me to understand or to collect the feedback from the students it's very hard for me to know am I going too fast or too slow or right at the speed also well you are watching the material on the TV or on your computer it's very possible that some distraction will come in your kids want you to get him or her an ice cream your wife want you to take out of the trash where you suddenly feel hungry and you want to go to the refrigerator and a get a snack all those things will chip in will actually distract you from the learning so you have to understand the difficulty you're going to face and be prepared okay the second thing I want to talk about is the midterm in the final exam you probably see in the syllabus that all the materials will be delivered online but the midterm and the final exam will be conducted physically on campus okay we will reserve room with a reader slot so that all of you can come here and sit down and take the exam that's why we actually reserved the time slot in the Friday afternoon so that you will not have another course conflicting with it okay part of the reason that we will organize such a physical exam is that first we want to get a chance of face-to-face communication okay although it's very short and a second it will be very hard for me to prevent any types of cheating if we are holding the exams online I understand that there are Proctor surfaces available now but my understanding is that they will charge your actual money just to sit in some place to conduct the midterm or final so that's why we still choose to have the exam face to face on campus I have to emphasize that there is another session of the 6200 running by dr. Tim Conway this semester so if his class time works for you better feel free to switch to his class it's totally fine so thank you for watching this extended introduction I will see you more frequently in the next week's and thank you
