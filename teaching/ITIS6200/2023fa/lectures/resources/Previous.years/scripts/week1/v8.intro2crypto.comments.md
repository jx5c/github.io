good morning and welcome to welcome back to our 6,200 class and first I want to make a few points clear before we start today's video shooting please note that by accident I posed a playlist link in the course webpage I noticed that there for the Tampines cryptography course there are videos in the playlist so if you'll click play it will continue to play video number one number two number three and so on so forth please make sure we only need you to watch the very first video which contains ten minutes and if you have watched that you probably notice that the video is very very intense compared to the first video that we post the cyber security overview of the lady presentation you will notice that also done Bernays video is only ten minutes long it contains much more content so um that's why we are generating this commenting video second there are some questions sent to me by the students said hey dude your comment video is even longer than the original video so um what's the point this is the reason from my understanding I think there are two ways of teaching knowledge in the class so one way is that we give you those very very condensed like Europe coffee style knowledge so we pitch your nuggets after nuggets after nuggets so that everything will have two minutes every video will be about two minutes three minutes and the expectation is that you have very solid background and at the same time for every minute that we pitch in the video we want you to spend fifteen minutes at least of the class to think about it to understand it to search the web page for more materials and so on so forth another way is we we don't picture those very intense nuggets but we put a lot of explanation for those concepts give you examples and I hope that you will understand that stuff better in the trade-off you do not need to spend as much time offline to figure things out so I prefer this style over the first style because based on my 7-8 years teaching experience we only see people or students saying slow down can you repeat this part we want more example we very certainly see people said oh yeah I've already know that go faster skip that part let's run really really fast or let's just take off so I have the rather take this time okay third point you can see we zoom in a little bit for this video taking because there is feedback basically saying my hand movements it's too much and start to impacting people understanding and another feedback this is the third video you're shooting you're still wearing the same shirt are we going to see you wearing this shirt throughout the semester I can show you know this happens by accident and you're going to see me wearing other my other shirts wait okay come back to the Tampines video and our comment the first comment I won't have is that at about 48 seconds in his video he makes a few recommendation for this courses if you look at the screen first is take notes second is post a video frequently and a think about the materials - sir - answer the in-video questions we probably do not have the third thing because the video capturing software provided by UNC Charlotte we do not have the capability to embed this quiz and the questions in that but I strongly recommend you to take the first two suggestions take notes think about it if you don't understand send me an email or post it in the discussion board so that we can help each other the second the comment I want to provide happens at about two minutes 18 seconds in this video and Don Berna is introducing cryptography okay he actually emphasizes this later in his video but I want to reinforce I to be here which is cryptography is not the automated solution to all security problem cryptography is a building block for our security approach okay there are several layers of explanation to this first cryptography and their many conditions are beautiful some algorithms when people designed us people think that okay this algorithm is safe and after 10 20 years of research of development and then people figure out that ok what that assumption is wrong and it's no longer safe so it's very possible that we could have or we are actually using some unsecure encryption algorithm and a second even if an encryption or rhythm itself is safe we face many other problems and challenges for example when we say algorithm is safe as we put it on the paper and we prove that it's beyond the computation capability of even any human being or any aliens so let's say tomorrow aliens from the Mars landed lands on earth and we can assure you that even if they have a super duper computer they cannot break it we can prove that the problem is eventually you needed to translate this paper based design to a computer program and when people implement things weird thing could happen they had they were embedded bugs they do they will have bugs in the software implementation and many things could go wrong okay so you you could ended up using insecure implementation of a secure crypto algorithm last but not least the reason that we say security cryptography is only a building blocks to implement security actually temporarily later give out some example like software implementation bugs or social engineering based attack so it's very very possible just consider this okay so if you buy the most expensive parts from factories and put them together to build a car are you going to have the best car in the world not necessary right because you have to put the right part in the right place the best part or the most expensive parts does not well put them together if you put them in the wrong way it will it will not give you the better car it's the same thing okay you pick different components to build a security approach to make sure your information and your infrastructure is secure you want the suitable ones you want the best fit ones you don't want the most expensive one or you can say that oh I have an encryption algorithm this algorithm using 1,000 bit key this algorithm using 2,000 bit key which one should I choose I should always choose the 2000 bit key algorithm because the key is longer it's safer not necessary it depends on what type of problems you're solving and whether or not for example are you using your cell phone to implement is this algorithm going to be put on your cell phone can your cell phone even handle those 2,000 bit key algorithm so you got to be very very careful about it okay and the one thing one concept Tampere mentioned in this slides but that's not explained attentively it says user authentication the user authentication is basically you want to prove to the system who you are for example every day when you login you have your username and then the password the password is actually an authenticating procedure to prove to the system who you are and as another example you go to the bank and you said ok I want to withdraw $100 cash and then the bank attendant or the clerk at the bank you already asked you to show them a federal issued ID for example your driver's license what are they verify they are verifying your identification that's an authentication procedure they want to make sure that when we withdraw $100 cash from your account you are actually getting the cash otherwise if there's no authentication if I know you're at a number I would just get into the going into the bank and I said okay I want withdraw $200 cash and I wanted withdrawal from the bank account 1 2 3 4 5 6 and if there's no authentication procedure they just give me this $200 from your account you will not be very happy for this slice we do not have too much to explain but I want to remind you one thing you can notice that tamper nice slice use a lot of acronyms like HTTPS SSL or TLS so if tamper nee does not explain those concept and if we don't need to use them later we will not provide explanation but if we are going to use them later and when we start to explain or while we introduce the protocol we are going to give you a very detailed explanation so don't worry too much about those acronyms at this moment ok for this slide Stamper Nathan first time introduced there are two types of encryption algorithm why it's called a public key cryptography or sometime they called asymmetric encryption algorithm let me say a symmetric means they are not similar they are basically talking about there are two keys why is called public key the other is called private key and you cannot derive out the private key based on the public key so so when you incredible you use one key and will decrypt you the another key the two keys are different or different so this is the asymmetric encryption algorithm and you example include RSA or some asymmetric encryption algorithm we are going to discuss the second time is called a symmetric encryption algorithm which means actually tamper nay explain it this extensively in his video so the encryption key in the decryption key are the same they're the same so you'd you use this key to encrypt and you use the very same key to decrypt okay and this is the reason we call it a symmetric because those two keys are exactly the same okay there are two things we want to clarify here first in some cases in some cases the even way its symmetric encryption algorithm the encryption key and the decryption key may be different however you can easily derive out one key from another so if I give you one key like I give you the encryption key you can derive out the decryption key if I give you the decryption key you can derive out the encryption key although those two kids are not the same you can derive out one out easily from the other then this is still symmetric encryption algorithm the asymmetric encryption encryption algorithm or the public key encryption algorithm you cannot derive out the private key from the public key so this is one thing we want to clarify the second thing we won't clarify is we often get this question in the class the question is is asymmetric encryption algorithm always more secure than symmetric encryption algorithm our answer is not our answer is no okay what depends so if you google it or if you go to Wikipedia Wikipedia you will notice that encryption or rhythm used keys okay and the key has its lens and then most of time there will be a table you can actually google it and you know Wikipedia there is a table the table on the left-hand side it has the symmetric encryption algorithm on the other side you have a symmetric encryption algorithm and then they show the key lines they compare the key lens and you will notice that to reach the same level of security the asymmetric encryption algorithm used much much longer key it was much much longer key for example the ECC that you live elliptic curve cryptography tow it's an asymmetric encryption algorithm it's key is about twice the length of symmetric encryption algorithm when we consider the same level of security if you are using RSA the key is even much much longer the key is much much longer so I want to make sure you understand not necessarily the asymmetric encryption rhythm is safer than the symmetric now we add about minute six of this video I just want to provide you one suggestion or one recommendation is slow down slow down watch the video at least twice at least twice think about it think about it so my my filling is that Dan Burnett goes very very fast in this video and it contains a whole lot of content unit okay and one other thing is the encryption algorithm should be publicly known and you should never use algorithm and the algorithm said okay um I cannot tell you how we design the algorithm but trust me it's secure because we got the designer graduated from MIT with a master with a PhD degree in math okay this does not solve the problem so whenever you see a solution like this and okay just trust us because we have an MIT guy then this algorithm must be safe this is not true this is totally not true okay this actually happens to us once there was one company trying to present or trying to sell us something they basically using the same to this justification the designer of our girl rhythm greater from X Y Z okay so it must be saying this is not true and also consider this now we have those virtualization or cloud computing or virtual machine technology even if you have a software you give me only your execution code and if we put it in a virtual machine or put it against some computer instruction and or later we will figure out what your algorithm is doing okay we will figure it out eventually how your algorithm is doing so we want to make sure you understand that the safety of this encryption algorithm comes from the key the secrecy of the key we need to keep the key as a secret it does not come from the secrecy of the encryption algorithm itself okay please remember this
