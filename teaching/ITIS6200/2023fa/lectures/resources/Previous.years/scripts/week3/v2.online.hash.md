good morning everyone and welcome back to 6200 8200 a class here we are going to recorder a short video about hash calculation and the hash usage there will be multiple video clips posted after this one to explain the hash function in detail but before that let us do two things so if you look at the screen we're at www-we filed out calmness it's just a 1 of this download file provider webpage and here you can see ok if you scroll down the the page you're going to see 40 UI checksum Tidus generator does not require and you can download this exact the file ax e which is just a little bit over 1 mega and immediately after it just after the download link and provide md5 value of this exe file and sha-1 value of this tell download the file and you can see these are all in hex values that's why you see the value from 0 all the way to F okay similarly if you have a tip which is very small only 146 K PI and they also provide this md5 and sha-1 in fact multipole a software company for example the VMware if you are downloading and application from VMware you're going to see the link they provide and a right next to the downloaded file link it will provide an md5 and sha-1 so if you have heard about md5 or sha-1 that's good if you have not take a quick google and you're going to see md5 and sha-1 are both very popular or widely used hash function and you can throw some file into this as function and it will give you a hash rate out we're going to introduce the calculation of the function and also how do we use this hash without but I want to show you here this example you have the ton of the file and you have the hatch without correspondingly so after you download the file before you actually unzip it or run it on your computer you'll first need to verify whether or not the hash rate of it's accurate if the hash rate down matches to the hash result of the file that you download that's great you have downloaded the right file otherwise you're better double-check before your run it ok to the left you can hear here the webpage link you can see it's called online md5 comm this one provide online calculation of different hash values so if you scroll down you can see there are two ways of generating the hash result you can either upload a file and it will catch either will hash the file and give you the corresponding hash without for example here you can choose md5 sha-1 sha-256 okay depends on how long do you want the hatch without to be another way of generating hash result is even either which is oh you can just type your plain text here and in the machine will calculate the hash result right here for you in real time for example we just to choose md5 here okay you can you can see which was md5 here and here we're going to type in a string which is 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ok so you can see as I type the train the town that has readout displayed here actually are changing in real time for example if we delete my can see either will change immediately we put the knife back okay so now I want you to remember the last of four digit of this hash value F to c7 F to c7 okay this is a lot of footage it of this hash it out so now we're going to change a little bit just a little bit to the string what do we mean we know that when we type down the characters here they are actually getting the ASCII code into the system and we know in ASCII code this this numbers from 0 to 9 they are right next to each other okay you can you can search the ASCII code and you can see they're right next to each other so if we change the last letter from 9 to 8 there is actually only one bit or a two bit change in the ASCII code however the md5 result will be quite different so if you look at here currently we have 9 and the last of 48 is f2 c7 okay so now let's change this the last dated to 8 okay you can see here they're totally different they're totally different okay so in this way this is actually a good feature of the hash function of a good hash function if you have a very small change in the clear tag you will have a huge change in the hash without okay similarly if we change the result which in to answer a 1 which is much longer the last of footage it will be a a DB and if we change this string back to 9 and you can see it change from aatb to 7-0 16 so it's quite different okay as the last determine demo we are going to upload a large file here the largest allowed file is 4 GB which is a DVD but we're not going to actually upload a DVD here on the contrary we're going to upload a relatively large file you can see here this is a hash function protein and usage mp4 file you're going to see later in this week which is 61 mega so let's upload it you can see it's pretty clear it's very fast to up it's very fast to upload this file and the cat hash calculation is actually pretty fast as well so you can see it's actually very fast to do the hash calculation remember this is oh and this is actually conducting a on a remote computer okay that's why hash will suit the requirement of not only on the server's and the desktop machines but can also satisfy the requirement that we put on the mobile phone or even pad that is very important in those in this mobile computing life now okay so this is a very short video to show you the hash of the calculation of the hash and also how can we use the hash like we said earlier multiple video will be provided for you to have a better understanding of the hash function okay thank you and see you in the next video
