okay so let us go back to the slides we have and we have mentioned that in the previous week slides we discuss something about cementery encryption and asymmetric encryption but we said we're going to leave the problem of hash function to this week because hash function is a very very powerful tool that is widely used okay so in the previous week we shortly discussed this when they function and the trap door when they function which we can use to actually the asymmetric encryption is a trap door limit function so let's go back to this one-way hash function which is widely widely used okay so if you look at the slide it basically says a one-way hash function will map a variable LAN to input a string to a fixed the lancet string okay in the video earlier we post a Tuesday of this week we actually demonstrated we actually go to a webpage that does online hash calculation we actually demonstrate so you can input you can input a string as short actually in that video if you watch it we input the different strings like 0 1 2 all the way to 9 and at the bottom the webpage is calculating md5 in real time actually if you look at the video carefully you will see as soon as you type down the first character 0 there is a value of showed up here so they already have finished hashing the 0 and after you type 1 it becomes 0 1 it started hashes here 1 so this the md5 value is actually changing in real time so it can be a very very low file you can hash a 4 gigabyte DVD which is totally fine or you can just hash one byte both case they will give you a 128 or 256 bits value it depends on what hash function you're using okay so let's see there are quite a few requirement there are a few requirement of a good hash function so the first a requirement of course the first a requirement is that it's very easy to generate the hash of the file X if I give you the value of x okay so basically if I give you the file you can hash very quickly your real time actually if you look at the performance of many of the hash function this dates they can probably have several mega hundred several hundred megabytes in one second with a decent computer so the hashing is really fast the second requirement it's almost impossible to find a file X such that hash x equals two y so what do we mean so if I give you a back why the Y is actually a hash value I ask you to find an X such that hache x equals 2y this is a very very hard if you are securing if you are selecting a secure hash function it's almost practically impossible for you to do that so okay so if I give you a hash value of y is practically impossible for you to find the x such that hash x equal to 1 so let's look at a certain requirement the certain requirement that said it's almost impossible to find two files X and X Prime that they have the same hash value this is a very very interesting fact so if you look at the video that we post earlier in this week on the hash function it's a surprisingly interesting fact why is that so let's say we are using a 100 I'm sorry let's say we are using a 128-bit let's say we are using a 128-bit hash result but we know there are many many more files there are many many more different files in the ward then to ^ 120 okay so if you have a 128-bit hash value on the other side that you have many many more files in the ward than 2 ^ 128 so what does that mean we can derive out since every file you can actually hash up so that basically means you have many many different files you have many many files that are that are more than 2 ^ 128 but on the other side you have only 2 ^ 128 diff in the basket your hash a file and based on the result you're going to put the file into that basket if the in hash - that value you put that file in the basket your has a file it's in the basket your hash a file in the basket you only have 2 to the power of 128 basket and on the other side you have many many more files than the number of basket what does that mean that basically means there will be there will be two files hashing to the same page without I'm still new to this welcome to and I keep pushing that special button so there are actually different files we're hashing to the same hazards out the only problem is that the third property of a good hash function said yes there are files hashing to the same place however you could not find them okay so it's a very interesting fact and also minor changes in the in the plane in the in the source there will be very big change in the hash acts we also demonstrated this in the video ok so let's say the hash value is shorter we have this conflict so in this way we can look out files but cannot guarantee this is the original file so what does that mean so what do we mean said we can do our files but we cannot guarantee this is it ok so let's say one day you have a file you want to prove that your own it so you want to prove to the ward that you always file on on the pide I don't know whatever day you want so what do we do you have the file X and you're just hash X okay so you got a 128-bit string it's the hash straight out of the file and then you'll go to Charlotte Observer which is the local newspaper here and of course all the newspaper has a you know advertisement or classified at all in which you pay them $10 or $20 I don't know how much you have to pay them but it should not be too too expensive and you can post it something like I want to find my dog I'm looking for my soulmate or I'm looking for a 49 1949 German machine that whatever okay you can pay $20 and they will print it for you so what do you do you pay them $20 and you ask them to publish this 128 bit string on the newspaper okay so what's the good thing the good thing is if you select the secure has function no one will be able to rebuild the file X by looking at your 128-bit string so no one will look at it string said hmm I think this is a copyrighted copy of the movie you know hunger game number four there's no way people can figure that out okay at the same time you have a proof that actually you own this fire on this specific day so let's say later you enter some lawsuit that you have to prove that and in that specific day you already have this one we already know this one you will be able to go to any library and get a copy of that day Charlotte Observer and a show to the court said okay this is the hash read out that I published on that day okay on that day and everybody will be able to rehash X and it should equals to the value of that I publish okay and in this way you can prove that you own this file okay so now let's come back a little let's step back one step so what is the chance so what is the chance that you don't so what is the chance that you don't have X but you want to come you want to come the word to show that you actually have X so of course you can generate some random 128 a bit string and a publish it there's nothing can prevent you from generate a random 128 bits manual and a publish on the newspaper okay just pay them $20 and let's say 20 years later you'll find that oh there's a file X which is very very valuable now I want to prove in the court that I own an X on that specific PDA so you go to the court and show the hatchery that ok so let's look at the chance since this file is specific so it's hash value is predetermined okay so basically it's like this I'm thinking about a 128 bits value so now you take a wild guess so basically I will write it down okay you don't see it but I will write it down you take a wild guess and what is the chance that you gasps this 128 bits value correctly okay since there are two to the power of 128 two to the power of 108 and you will be able the chance that you take a wild guess and you guessed correctly is 1 in 2 to the power of 128 this value is a little bit too small in your favor in your favor this is actually much much worse than the two weeks ago 600 million Powerball winning chance so if you have the luck that you can guess 128-bit key correctly my suggestion is you go to spend two dollars buy a Powerball and win 600 million dollars which is much more efficient of changing your life quality instead of just casting a hash function okay so now let's go to this problem then let's look at another case okay so now the problem is no what is the chance okay so let's go back to this problem so let's say you publish something on the Charlotte Observer and then later you enter a lawsuit and of course the other side lawyer will say oh you know what I don't think that guy all on file X at that time I think he just published some random number and then of course you will be able to prove that it's a very very low chance that I guess it correctly and then from the scientific point of view okay listen to me we're talking about scientific point of view we're not saying whether or not the other set lawyer is really good so it's possible that the other side get a really good lawyer to convince their to rate that's beyond our control okay so it's a little bit like this so let's say in the criminal sin the police finally or fingerprint and then your lawyer will testify that oh from the science from the scientific theory there is one in fifty one in six billion chance that there are two different persons having the same fingerprint so see erratically it's possible that it is you or the other party there is a yn6 billion chance there's another person in the same city having the same fingerprint as you so it's very possible it's that guy and do you think the Tory will buy this my feeling is that they will risk the chance that putting an innocent you into jail with the of one-in-six building so that's why we can say it's very easy to rule out files the world found basically means oh if you have a file T and we hashed E and they don't match the hash value you publish we know that it is that it's not this file but if even if that the hash value match to the value that you publish there is a still a small small small chance that this is not the original file how small we can make it any smaller world why we can design a secure hash function which generate very very long hash it out and then the chance that this is not the original file become really really really small ok so now let's continue and what can we do what can we how can we use with the hash function and of course we have shown that we could a timestamp a file so basically just like we said if you want the time to Emma file you can hash it and you can publish on the local newspaper okay another possible value application is the hash value of the downloaded files and this also got mentioned in the postage in our posted a video so if you go to vmware and if you try to download a virtual machine image or any software package these days hey so let's say you want to download a software you want to download a software package and of course it's a yixi file and before you run that you want to make sure this is the real fire so what do you do most of the webpage these days they will publish the hash without of the software so you'll download this Exe file and you'll hash this exe file and then compare to the publish the value of the hash without if they're the same you know you downloaded the correct and file and if they're not the same you know there's something wrong and of course you have you have watched that video it clearly says so let's say this is a vet page this is web page and this is the software and you can download and the right side of this software it publishes md5 and if you have watched the video we publish the guy has mentioned that oh if the bad guy could compromise your webpage basically the bad guy will put the contaminated the dirty the malicious software here of course it will be able to change the md5 well is that right I totally agree with him so that's why actually there are some other solutions to prevent this thing so this hash leads out or sometimes we call it a message authentication code it's very very important in several cases so let's discuss this a little bit ok so let's say you have a software oops sorry so let's say you have a software so let's say this software is generated by Adobe ok and the Adobe does not want everybody to go to Adobe's server to download it because if everybody goes to Adobe server to download it Adobe server will be very very busy so what do they want just to publish this software executable file to some p2p software download the website so now you can download it from a p2p web page and of course Adobe you want to make sure you download at the right one you download the right one okay so you have the exe file but the dhobi want to make sure you download the right one so what do we what will Adobe do Adobe will publish the hatchery dot and of course not only Adobe needed to publish the hash readout Adobe needed to digitally sign the hash result what does I mean basically Adobe will publish the md5 of the file F and then Adobe will sign with her private key of this md5 value okay so now you go to any p2p web page you download the exe file okay and before running it make sure your hash this file to get this value to see whether or not it published it is the same as the published by Adobe and even before you change before to after that verify the digital signature of Adobe so what do you need to verify this digital signature you need Adobe's public key to verify to open this up to actually see the md5 value and compared to the hash result of this file you download and in that case you can be sure that it's a real file the chance that the bad guy generate a contaminating file but having the same hash without is really really really low okay so now let's go to another so so what's the difference between the between this digitally signed md5 and the value and that scenario we demonstrate before the scenario we demonstrate before is this is a file and this is md5 okay so if you just publish your md5 and clear text here if the bad guy has compromised your webpage if it could change the file here it definitely could change the md5 value however if you actually digitally sign this md5 value even if the bad guy compromised your webpage he will not be able to do that why because how can you generate digital signature only if you'll know the private key so the bad guy could compromise your webpage but it needed to change this md5 value only if the bad guy could also generate the digital signature of this change in md5 value in other words the bad guy not only compromised your webpage also get a knowledge of your private key so in that case you're you're doomed so let's say that you're doomed so there's nothing we can do about it
