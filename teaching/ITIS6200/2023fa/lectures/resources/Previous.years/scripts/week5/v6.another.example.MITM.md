come on the everyone and welcome back to the 62 180 200 class and in this session we are going to introduce the man in the middle attack so in the previous slides and also several videos that we post when they discussed a DV Hellman protocol an example of man in the middle attack has been presented so in this short video we're going to pretend a real-life case and explain why men in the middle attack becomes possible and how are we going to defend against to this ok so this case has nothing to do with security but is involved three young persons ok here is the case so let's say we have three persons one is Bob and the Bob's evil friend David and a girl Alice and of course with this days everybody has a cell phone and the phone number of Bob is represented by P Bob and the full number of Alice is represented by P Alice and the debate is some certain kind of a special kid he has two cell phone and we call them David one and David - I hope by now you understand that wherever we're going okay so one day Bob and David go to the local dance club and the Bob saw Alice for the first time and he has crossover Alice and he wants to get Alice's phone number and of course Bob is a very very shy guy and that's why here you need a wingman David t-bone kid but David said okay Bob don't worry I will get your her phone number just don't worry about okay so David go to Alice said Oh Alice you'll see that boy Bob he has a crush over you and you know he really want to get your phone number but unfortunately you know he's a very very shy guy and he asked me to get your phone number so fortunately for Bob Alice also has a good feeling about the boy Bob so Alice is very happy and Alice said ashore this is my phone number PA and by the way what is Bob's from number since you know Bob and the David like we just introduced it's an evil boy instead of a benign kit and here when we say David is evil we don't mean David is going to do something you know really really bad but their baby is a very very curious guy so David to try to figure out what's going on between Alice and Bob he's not going to ruin the relationship but he really want to you know know what's going on and so that you can brag about it so instead of giving Alice Bob's real phone number P B they way to give her one of his phone number let's say P D one okay so now in Alice's phonebook Alice add a new entry which his name is Bob the phone number is pd-1 remember this phone number actually belongs to David and then David after getting a little number PA and very happily come back said about you owe me big I got you her phone number you owe me really really big and the Bob will of course say yes yes yes oh you big I owe you big so you already give her my phone number right Davey said yes I have and here is the girl Alice's phone number okay since Bob and David they're good friends and Bob probably already know the pd-1 which is the primary phone number of David but Bob does not know David has a separate phone number P D - so they made it just to give him a new phone number called the PD - said hey this is the phone number of the girl so now involves phone block we have Alice PD - okay so now everything is down and then Bob go home and the wait for two days and then call the girl so when he tries to call the girl he will dial the number pd2 and guess whose phone will start to ring of course it's David its second phone so Bob thinks that he is calling Alice and David a second the phone it's ringing so as soon as David sees that his second phone started ringing and a note if the number is from Bob he will immediately start calling Alice without picking up the second phone he will first to call Alice so the pd-1 will start to call Alice and in Alice's phone when the pd-1 number of rings the name showed up will be Bob so Alice will think that ah bah bah finally calls me okay so Alice will pick the full up as soon as Alice picked a full up David will pick up he's phone number too so now it's like this well I'm pretty bad at or so this is Bob's cell phone and the Bob calls the phone number PD tool of David which he sinks belongs to Alice and then David used his phone number one this is PD one koulos and Alice believe that sorry should be a full number Alice will believe that actually it's Bob calling her and then David will put a speaker over the microphone and the microphone over the speaker between the two phone and once he put the two phones together he will put a two phone to his ear and it start to listen to the talk between islets and a bomb and the only thing that alleys in the Baba will notice that there is pretty bad a sound quality the sound quality is not good okay because basically the voice will come out from this speaker and get into the other side of microphone the quality will be great but that's roughly the only thing okay and then so this is a very good example of man the middle this is a very good example of man-in-the-middle and in this case Davida is actually the attacker okay and what make this attack especially bad or which make the attack especially harder to detect is now now if Alice and a bob so now is basically we have something like this okay we have Alice and Bob are talking to each other and the day way that we'll be able to listen to everything okay so now this attack is very very bad and very very um well how to say it has very severe impact because it's very hard to detect why let's look at this because Alice is really talking to Bob so Alice is not talking to David who impersonated Bob on the contrary Alice is really talking to Bob the only problem is David will be able to see everything online okay so Alice can verify Bob's identity you can ask a Bob's name his mother's name father's name date of birth favorite car favorite food everything he will pass it he will pass all the questions that you have for this type of authentication why because you're really talking to Bob you're not talking to another person okay and it's similar for Alice bakka oscar alice's date of birth social security number first elementary school elementary school best friend teacher whatever you want to ask she will pass the authentication okay so basically if you look at here the packet will first reach David David to take a look at the packet and then send it to Alice send it to Alice again okay of course in here there's no get a packet look at it and in stand it basically I'm putting the two phones next to my ear and I will be able to see it okay I will be able to I'm sorry I will be able to hear it so in this way the traditional mechanism such as authentication or password or cold will not really work okay so now let's step back one one step and see why so let's see why this may in the middle attack men in the men attack is possible so why I've made them in attack as possible so let's look at here so what actually caused the trouble or actually caused the trouble what actually caused the trouble is this bundle between an identity and a full number in this sub cific example and again the diffie-hellman protocol or in the man-made attack related to the distribution of the public key is the bundle between the identity and the public key okay so let's look at this problem so basically whatever what David gave up is actually a phone number right a phone number is just a ten digit number and the based on the ten digit number you cannot tell any property of the owner of this phone number for example calcio this is an all the number that's ten dated so the owner should be a boy instead of a girl you don't have that or you cannot say oh the meadow three number of this phone number is 555 this is really ugly it does not look like a beautiful girl at like alice's phone number can tell this type of thing thus the phone number have this type of property you can tell anything about the owner you cannot so basically now we are facing a problem forfeiting problem okay in this attack and also several other types of man-made attack what we are going to try to achieve is we have an identity at the same time on the other side we have a piece of the information and what we're going to do is we're going to borrow them together sorry the the painting to set actually frees itself so we have to reset it okay so let's pick up where we left okay so what the man-made attack make this man-made attack possible is that okay in this certificate case the phone number example we have an identity and we have a piece of the information so we have Alice and a PA and we have Bob and PB and what we try to do is that we want to bind the two pieces of the information together the identity and this piece of information together and approve that or to show or to prove to other party that this piece of information actually belonged to this identity actually belongs to this identity okay if there is no such binding and this could lead to some potential harmful attack okay and in our subset example we said oh this is a full number and that like we just mentioned a phone number is just a 10 digit number this phone number and that phone number look exactly the same from my point of view there is no property associated with the phone number and this this phone number does not show itself to whom it belonged okay so that's why when the bad guy debate change from Alice phone number - Alice phone number daily the - there's nothing we can detect because both of them are ten digit number so it's impossible for us to figure out oh this is not right okay so now let's go back to the manda middle attack that they described in the diffie-hellman protocol so if you recall in the diffie-hellman protocol you have the similar situation you have a generator G you have a B prime number P this guy also know G and Alice will generate a random number RA and Bob will generate a random number RB and then Alice will send T to the power of RA modular P okay so now let's look at this thing okay what we're trying to bind here we're trying to say that Oh Alice and this random number are a they are together Alice generate ra but not anybody else okay we're trying to prove to the other party on this or at least we want to make sure the other party believe this okay and then what the bad guy the malicious guy will actually do the malicious guy will generate our m1 which is his own random number so it will calculate a T to the power of our m1 modular P okay now let's look at a Bob's point of view okay so there are two random numbers one is ra the other is our my there are a whole bunch of random bits is there is there a way that out that Bob can tell you this number looks really malicious so it must be ants random number and this random number looks much more beautiful and I think that's it is generated by a benign party is there a way that Bob can tell that obviously cannot so that's why and that's why in this diffie-hellman protocol if there's no protection at all about the bonding between Alice and its random number Bob and its random number the bad guy will be able to conduct the measurement you know attack actually in the real life there are several other examples also lead to this man in the middle attack so you try to assume that an identity and the corresponding piece of information are bound together and in reality it is actually not and the bad guy will actually break this binding and make your assumption invalid and the replace the piece of the information with its own the information and which will lead to later the problem later its problem okay so how can we defend against this man-made attack okay how can we defend against this man-made attack so there are we're going to introduce two types of approaches let's say so so next we needed to discuss the defense against a man tomato attack okay so here we said there's identity Alice and there's a piece of the information array here could be the random number could be the phone number of the public key we want to make sure they're bound together okay currently there are two approaches the first approach is that let's use a trusted third party to prove let us use a trusted a third-party to pull this by name okay so somebody will show you that this identity and this piece of information are bound together or there's another way we're going to introduce in the next set of slides to defense against the man the middle attack which is basically to make the replacement of information impossible you could either say it's impossible or really really hard which we're going to show you in the next set of slides so here for this clip we're going to stop here so in this clip we introduce what is man-made attack and we give a real-life example using the phone numbers and we explain the reason that the man-made attack becomes possible is because the parties the communication parties trying to bind an identity and the corresponding piece of the information together also there's no solid evidence to support this finding okay so to solve this problem we either provide a kind of mechanism to prove this binding or we make this replacement of the information very hard or impossible which we are going to cover in the next set of slides in the following weeks okay so we will stop here for this session and I will see you for the next time
