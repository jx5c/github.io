another question about the hash function is also it's very interesting they said oh you have 128 bits hash without you have wonder tornado hash it out and altogether you'll have 2 to the power of 128 possible hash values and this is a huge number this is a huge number and the question is how can two different the message have the same hatcheries out in theory is this not possible and you write down impossible I assume you actually mean possible okay so the question is how can two files having the same hash reads out if all possible you know the possible space of the hash tree that is so big okay you would say that Oh 2 to the power of 128 is a huge number I agree with you it's a huge number however the number of files the number of files the number of different files is much larger than the possible of hash values the number of files is much much larger than the possible hash values why so let's look at a very simple example you would say that Oh 2 ^ 128 it's a huge number and I will show you that why the number of files is much larger than 2 to the power of 100 on it first you generate a file and this file the requirement of the file is very simple is 128 lines okay we know that every word file you will have something like 70 80 lines so if you you have a two-page word file you you you generate a file that contains tornado lives okay so let's say this is the file it contains 120 the lines okay okay now I want you to make some change to the end of each line what do we mean okay so let's say we have 128 lines and I want you to look at the very last character of every line okay and let's forget about the Kurama English grammar requirement okay for the last character of every line I want you to either add a comma layer or add a period there okay you can say that oh no no you cannot do that if you add a comma it breaks the sentence it does not read right I agree with you and what I'm saying is that let's temporarily forget about this grammar thing okay the temporary forget about this grammar thing so the last character of every line I want you to put either a comma or a period and I want you to generate different files okay this file can hit one 228 lines I want you to generate a different files of different combination of the laughter character it's either comma or a period for example you can have all 28 lines they all end the width comma or you can have all out of the 128 lines you have 127 comma and a 1 period and of course this period can be like line 1 line 2 line 3 all the way till line 128 okay now you see where we're going okay so for the last character it's either a comma or a period so what for the last character of every line you have two toys you have two choices and since there are 128 lines and theoretically you can generate 2 to the power of 128 files remember the content are the same the only thing we're changing is those punctuation of the last character of every line okay it's either comma or period and you can actually generate a to ^ 128 files and this files are highly similar this files are highly similar the only difference is how many commas and how many period are there and where are they okay and with this files you just hash them you just hash them okay so if you're really really lucky if you're really really lucky every of this file will have a different hat without that basically means he'll I have generated a file that you know cover all the possible 128-bit hash wagons now you take a any other file let's go F your hash it you will find out some things another file in your heart I Drive with the same hash reason why because this two to the power of 128 files if if you're lucky and each file has a different hash it out you already cover all possible values and now whatever files we can come out you will find you will say that oh I have another file having to this hashing to the same hash it out okay so that's why it's very possible well it's it's no more than possible in and there are files there are files hashing to the same country down and that's why when you see now we are moving to longer hash result we had we are moving to 256 bits hatch without 384 base has retired and so on so forth we are going up we're going up it's just to reduce the possibility to reduce the possibility that files mmm hashing coalition okay so the last question we won't answer is about the cementery encryption and I believe one question said how is it possible that a block cipher that should have matching plaintext and a ciphertext blocks have a ciphertext that is longer than the plaintext okay so let's say so let's say we have 64 bits so since it's a block cipher let's say we have 60 bits plaintext blocks okay we have 64 bits plaintext blocks and we know that there are two to the power of 64 possible blocks okay because there are only 64 bits so all the possible values will be to the power 64 so let's imagine that magically we can design a a symmetric encryption algorithm that has any bits ciphertext we can have 8088 ciphertext okay and we know that in this side the possible space is much lighter it's two to the power of 80 okay so the problem is so let's say this are all the space of two to the power of 64 and every point every point in this space represent a possible plaintext block now let's see this side this side is much lighter this side is much larger this is two to the power of 80 and of course under a specific key under a specific key this node will be mapped to this node here there's no that will be mapped to this node here and so on and so forth okay remember if you fix the key then the clear tags and a ciphertext has a one-to-one mapping what does that mean that basically means here in this huge space you also only have two to the power of 64 80 bits blocks that can be decrypted it takes ry it can be decrypted okay out of two to the 80 possible values out of two to the possible to to the possible to ^ 80 possible values if you choose a specific key there will be only 2 to the power of 64 blocks 80 bits blocks that can be decrypted in other words this block this 80 bits block if you throw this in a bit block into the decryption function under this key the decryption function will say that I'm sorry this 80 bits block does not belong to the ciphertext of this key okay so we could not be decrypted okay this is how it's possible okay here you have to be very very careful why okay when you say oh under k1 this 80 bit block is not the cipher text of any 64 bits clear text but this same 8 8 bits block could be a ciphertext block under k2 you never know you never know okay so that's why it is possible that the cipher text is longer it's possible it's not seen frequently or it's probably very unfrequently that you see this but theoretically it is possible it is possible okay okay last up another list is a question about Merkel's who I'm sorry left but not list is a question about the Merkel's hash tree and in our class session we give you a mirko's hash tree I forget do we give you a 4 node or a eighth note so we give you a Merkel's hash tray I thing which is a binary tree okay it's about the hash publication the publication of the hash value the Merkel's tree and so there are questions in the discussion board said oh this are always you know even number of nodes in this in this Marko ashtray what if we have all the number of files what should we do okay actually if you look carefully this is more than even number this is actually two to the power of power two to the power of X we're talking about four files aid file sixteen files they're all two to the power of 2 to the power 2 to the power sum of number okay so the question is okay so if that day Charlotte Observer received only 11 files what should we do receive only 11 files what should we do of course you can have different approach so let's say okay well instead of 11 files let's consider another case we have only six files okay we have only six files so if we have only six files we are going to build something like this okay there are two possible approach the first approach is that the Charlotte Observer can generate a to fake files you know Charlotte Observer can put a to of today's newspaper story here and a generate the to fake LIF note and then from here they can go up okay this is one way okay this is one way and of course you could say that oh this is you know there are even easier examples either solutions so let's say you look at this complete a binary tree okay we we have mentioned that for every live node okay for every leaf node you will need another hash value from every level so that you can reconstruct the tree root for example this is no number six he needs laudanum node number six will need no the number five so that he can wreak rebuild this once he reach here he only needed this to rebuild this and then he needed this eventually the rebuild of the tree so I'm sorry so you need sorry you need only one node to reconstruct the tree root you need one node from each level to rebuild the tree root okay so let's look at it here so we only have six files today seven and eight there are fixed file they're all fake files and nobody will need them so instead of you generating two fake file seven eight the only thing Charlotte Observer is generated this fake node so let's say this is 128 bits why because node 5 and the node 6 when they try to hash the tree they need this they never need at the hash seven and hash eight so actually the Charlotte Observer only needed to generate one of this fake note and tool so that the whole tree can be reconstructed okay so here we provide us some discussion so you can either generate some leaf node to make it a complete a to ^ saying part two to the certain number of power or you only need to generate a fake notes for the you know for the note that somebody some real leaf need them to rebuild the tree for for here seven and eight we don't need them because they don't really need this file to rebuild the tree there are fake files so we only need to provide this to five and six ok I hope I answered most of your questions and okay I will see you in following videos have a good week thank you
