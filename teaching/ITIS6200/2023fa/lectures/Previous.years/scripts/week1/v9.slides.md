good morning everyone and welcome back to 62 180 200 a class in addition to the videos that we post we will also put slides into Moodle and from time to time we're going to recorder some video for the content in the slide the main reason is at the slice some time they provide relatively abstract information and we would we would like to provide a little bit more detailed explanation and please understand that when we posted the slides and also some video related to the slides we will not go over the slides page by page we will only emphasize the problem that might cause some confusion or misunderstanding okay so back to today's slides you can see when we talk about information security most of time we are enforcing three properties and we use their acronym to represent them they stand for C I and a please notice that the CI a here is not the agency that you watch in the movie very frequently on the contrary the CI and a actually stand for three words confidentiality integrity and availability okay that's the three properties summarize almost all requirement related to information and infrastructure security so the first property is confidentiality I think we don't have to explain why confidentiality is so important actually if you watched amber nice video Tempranillo actually emphasizes he said while police understand information security is more than encryption okay so you can see the confidentiality is definitely an important component in information security and of course encryption is a very important part in it okay we want to emphasize one thing here we actually here we blackened things out we emphasize us so you can see it's actually the existence of data we have this in the boat mode the reason is sometimes we not only need to hide the accurate information we need actually needed to hide actually the existence of such information for example if you google how many servers does Google have and you're not going to see some number pop up okay actually if you google there is one confirm the sort that I can see is actually from Microsoft Microsoft is then CEO Steve Ballmer make a presentation in the end of 2012 mentioned that Microsoft has 900k servers which is fewer than Google's server number so by the end of 2012 Google probably has a total of 1 million server you may ask why do we want to hide the information for example everybody knows that Google have has servers so why do we want to hide the accurate number examine this consider this ok if we do not know how many servers Google has then it's really hard for us to conduct a denial of service attacks on Google because you are not quite sure how much resource you may need right so that's why under many conditions people not only need to hide the accurate value of the data but also the existence of the data integrity deal with the authorized or improper change to information and here you can see when we talk about integrity we talk about both data integrity and the information source integrity so we need to consider the data itself is taught over C and a better or not the source of the information is trustworthy okay and when we see in this slide you see prevention it need to prevent an authorized to change and also changed in authorized ways what does it mean let's use the real-life example you have the bank account okay you can check your bank account balance on the network but are you allowed to adjust your balance can you just to give yourself two million dollars make your bank account two million and $50 you're not you're not allowed to make this changed which is prevent this and also write the changes and the what isn't authorized the ways of change for example the bank's staff member is allowed to change your balance you go to the bank you deposit two hundred dollar cash they will adjust your balance move it right two hundred dollars more okay but the staff member cannot just adjust it like crazy okay if he or she adjust two hundred dollars more into your account he or she needs to raise say that $20 cash or two hundred dollar check if without receiving any of this payment he or she change the balance that's a change in unauthorized ways last but not least is this availability issue this is also are very common because we need to figure out whether or not the data or resource is available to end-users and if you watch the TV news recently you know that seventy-seven the highway is going to expand a another pay Lane which is under big argument so we don't worry about that okay that's not our problem but I wanted to show you so this is a very good example of this resource problem okay so you have a seventy i seventy seven which you have two lanes on each side okay and in the busy time is blocked like how okay you may ask wait why don't we build eight lanes tymek that's will solve the problem you're totally right it will solve your traffic jam problem the only problem is where will the money come from right so you can see most of the resources they have this peak usage and you have this normal usage and at some time the peak usage could be multiple times of the normal usage then you have to decide okay how am i going to build the capacity of the facility of course you can build the facility here that basically means there will never be a dam there will never be a not enough resource the only problem is you need to invest a whole lot of money into it and when the system is operating normally a big chunk of resource will be wasted it do you want that okay so it's very difficult to detect the theater attack or we're just unlucky today and sometime the attacker could even mess up with your detection mechanisms sarasu is actually a potential violation of security and most of time we consider four types of threats disclosure deception disruption and the usurpation I think the meaning of this type of stress are pretty clear based on the name we will just explain one example for example if you look at the second case it's called modification is an also rise to change to data and it may lead to different problem it could lead to deception because you change the data the other party may retake wrong information so it's deception it could also lead to disruption for example if somebody change the command that Duke Energy sends to your smart meter and after the smart meter to shut off your power supply that's change of the data it will lead to disruption you will lose your power which will not be a very pleasant experience for end users and the last but not least it could lead to user patient for example you modify the authorization to a user which will give him or her the root access authority and then he or she will be able to grab the system and control it 100% policy and the mechanism this is a very interesting thing okay so policy is a statement of what is and what is not allowed and the mechanism are the master to actually enforce the policy for example a policy could be designed by the company high-level exact of you said okay our company webpage needed to be robust against denial surface attacks even when there are two hundred thousand hacker computers pinging us simultaneously okay so this is purely of policy even when there are two hundred thousand machines transmitting data to us our server cannot crash it's a policy and then the mechanism what is the mechanism now the IT department has to say oh okay now we need to support two hundred thousand users simultaneously what will be the value is what will be the processing capability what will be the bandwidth to the database so that we can access data how many copies of the database do we need those will all be the mechanisms to enforce such a policy last but not least all the systems security rest on assumptions of the required security mechanism and environment okay a real-life example okay you go to a good neighborhood like the shopping mall place and you see big glass window and you have very nice things displayed in the glass window okay if you go to a bad neighborhood even if it's a gas station or convenience store you see those metal bars you see the doors all have the metal bars to block okay this is a very good example of assumption so what type of assumption are you making in a good neighborhood you assume that there will not be a bad guy swinging a baseball bat and heat on the glass and steal the things inside on the contrary if it's a bad neighborhood or relatively general neighborhood you want to make sure your window and doors or have this metal bars the bad guy cannot break in and so on and so forth so when you have an assumption you're basically assume what type of resource and capabilities you're facing for example your system who will try to hack your system will that be some high school kids who only download some executable malware and try to attack your machine or is actually another countries spying agency or your competitors companies hire hiring some professional hackers to take over your webpage and that depending on what type of assumption you're making you are investing in different amount of money to build this security mechanism and then of course if your assumption is wrong you have never expected this thing could happen to you but then it happens then your system probably will not survive on the contrary just like we suggest earlier if you assume you make very very strong assumption like here ok so it never happens but of course to enforce a security level at this high you're going to get invest a whole lot of money so there will always be a trade-off ok so this is an experimental video and we recorder for this set of slides not long and hopefully you will enjoy it and the police let me know if you think we need to provide more details or we're going to slow we got to run fast kindly let me know okay thank you so much
