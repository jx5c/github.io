good morning everyone welcome back to our 6,200 class and in this video we're going to do a little bit comment on the video that you just did watch the reason that from now very frequently you are going to see this so we we post a video from YouTube or some other resources discussing some security issues or problems and then immediately after yet we're going to have a comment from the instructor or from some other experts the reason is on one side there are a gazillion resources online discussing different security problems and I have to admit that quite well not quite a lot of them are very good so it'll be great we could directly use them at the same time those videos are not generated by me or any expert that I know where I am familiar with so from time to time you will see that some of the important concept or some of the aspect of the problem they do not emphasize and the reason then we generated this kind of commenting video is just to make sure we re emphasize or we clarify some of those concepts the reason is that if we just a drag and find some video and post it online and we call oh this is an online course I'm not fully convinced that it's a good way to deliver the materials because well I have to admit that you're getting a video it's much better than I just hand you a book for example if we said ok let's did an online course and at the very beginning of the semester I give you a book and I give you a link to the slides associated with the book and I said ok this is online course go read the book if you don't understand redo the slice and if you throw still do not understand email I will try to answer your question I will see you at the final exam that's not a good way of delivering material this is the reason we are going to see a whole lot of this commenting videos from now I hope you'll enjoy this and the other issue or a little bit change we did or we do compared to the previous video is that you can see the camera a little bit of zooming out so my face is not that big or my head is not that big this is basically to help you to refocus on the slides not on me and also I'm not that handsome so you don't have to look at my face okay so back to our major point this is for the video that you just watch and if you look at the screen if you look at a screen it says cyberspace is a global domain of information systems infrastructure including blah blah blah blah blah blah okay what I want to emphasize or I want to add something in addition to what they're presenting is that if you look at her definition of a cyberspace it includes only the infrastructure it does not include the information you need this part I don't know they intentionally do this or there is some other concern why they do not do that from my point of view when we protect information security and privacy what are we doing we are protecting two things one is the infrastructure the second is the data unit so here I just want to assure you or I want to emphasize here please please please while you read this definition of cyberspace do not forget there is data and information flowing in this infrastructure and the information securing privacy of very very important aspect of that is to protect the data as well okay it says one thing I want to emphasize take the other thing at about seven minutes in this video this lady started to talk about a Bitcoin I don't know who invented a Bitcoin but he must be a genius why if you compare the United States to some other country you will notice that there is a big difference between United States and some other country I will not name because there's a video we're going to post it on YouTube I could not name any country otherwise I'm going to be in trouble okay there are some countries that they do not use credit card or debit card or cheques widely they used cash what's the major difference between those credit card checks or cash cash cannot be track it cannot be tracked checks credit cards and everything else can be tracked what does that mean if the money flow can be tracked then FBI or CIA or Police Department will be able to figure out what's going on if it's totally cash then it's very very hard because if I just hand you over an envelope and the envelope is very sick full of $100 vo and nobody will know I give you that unless they have video surveillance and even if they have video surveillance they cannot prove that it's actually cash and not garbage right so whoever well and back to the so Who Loved cash United States a very good thing is well if you look at it drug dealers like cash very well because you cannot track it okay also I don't know but I don't think the drug dealers accept the credit card right so let's back to our this problem whoever is a genius invented a Bitcoin the Bitcoin becomes something that cannot be traced okay so you use your credit card to buy some Bitcoin it can be a very small portion of one Bitcoin and it worth several hundred dollars and then you can use this Bitcoin to buy something that illegal and then it it is untrackable and the government agency this National Security Agency could not find out what's going on and actually the lady used another example of this they call it quick to Locker which is basically the bad guy break into your computer encrypt or your valuable files and ask for ransom and how are you going to pay them also use Bitcoin so whoever invented the Bitcoin I don't know what is his or her intention but obviously the mobs love it the I don't know the bad guys really really enjoyed this new way of payment and about 8 minutes and 30 seconds in this video she started to talk about the IP address and the better or not you can spoof some other people's address and send out a fake packets and actually she used her grandma's computer as an example here we just want to emphasize one thing that now the attacker can do two ways first is of course is IP address spoofing which Masek basically means the bad guy generated packets with other people's IP address the problem is this type of attack will not become an interactive procedure what does that mean so I can send you a packet in your grandma's computer's IP address but if your computer reply that reply will go to your grandma's computer it will not come back to me so it's very hard for me to conduct a multiple stab interactive attack so what are the bad guys are doing this days you guys probably heard about it the box right so actually we break into the bad guys break into your grandma's computer take the control of it but it does not just delete it a hard drive or do anything that you your grandma will notice there's something fishy on the contrary the bad guy break into your grandma's computer and lay very low okay nothing happens everything works fine and then when your grandma goes to sleep the bad guy since he or she already take the control the computer he or she can send a package to outside okay so this just want you to clarify this in on this page of the slides she actually talked about several types of attack and which we are going to cover in the later sections of the course so denied surface attack we are definitely going to cover it men the mean attack we are going to spend a lot of time to discuss it and we want to make sure that you understand the men the middle attack is more complicated than just exchange public keys which is a very common example of men demean attack and that we want to say a few words about this brute-force attack brute-force attack is what brute-force attack most of time means the bad guys try every possible solution to this problem and eventually it will break it for example we all know that now almost every hotel room has a safe in the hotel room and the most of time the hotels save you the 42 the pin right for example your your key can be one two three four so let's say you get out of the hotel room and somehow the bad guy sneaked in and what he can do or he what she can do to try to open the safe is well I could try every possible four-digit pin combination and one of them will definitely open it and how many combinations do I have because we have folded it and every digit has ten toys from zero tonight so all together we're going to have 10 to the power of 4 which is 10,000 possible choices okay if you leave enough room for the bad guy he or she can try every possible combination and eventually he or she will break it okay so this is a typical example of brute-force attack and of course by now you could and why we want you to use longer password because if you use longer password the bad guy has to try more combinations actually we're gonna explain it later in this course at what point your your password is actually long enough the brute-force attack is no longer a possible choice of the bad guy this brute-force attack is also related to the to the system assumptions so basically when your computer when you choose your security matters you want to make sure that okay I'm making an assumption what types of attackers am I facing so I might face some high school kids with one computer or am I facing a country with supercomputer and some clusters or some cloud behind it because the computation capability is different and the bad guys braking capability is different and then based on the assumption you have to try different and security matters well we're going to discuss this a little bit later but I just want to give you a heads up well the last example I want to put a little bit of comments is this cryptolocker thing this actually happens to one of my colleague aloft a semester so I will not name the person but it's very interesting there's one day my colleague suddenly come to me said okay this is what happens to my computer the bad guy break into my computer and encrypt all my pictures and videos at store on this computer and even worsse this virus or this malware the malicious software actually locate those external hard drive you pull up into the USB of your computer which you backup your data that have four terabytes external hard drive the malware actually find that external hard drive and encrypt everything on that hard drive and then of course there's a screen pop out said ok here pay us Bitcoin in Bitcoin with $300 worth of Bitcoin or else 72 hours later we are going to destroy your file and if you look at the ransom letter they use very very strong encryption algorithms such as RSA encryption algorithm with 2048 a bit key or they use ECC elliptic curve cryptography them--with it's a very very strong encryption algorithm and it's there's no way you can break it in 72 hours and even worse you cannot prove you can't prove that they actually use this in crypto algorithm to encrypt and even if you pay them they may still do not give you the key and you can do nothing about it so what can you do under lists common under this condition well the first thing you do of course is to unplug your computer and take the hard drive off so stop the clock on this hard drive and then whatever hard drive you try to save you mount it as and the external hard drive and Wow God well good luck with you because when the bad guy encrypted a picture file they will delete the old file okay we know that under many conditions when they deleted a file they don't permanently delete it they just to flip a few bits to show this file no longer exists but actually the contents of the files are still there so use some software use some software to locate those deleted files you still have a chance to save the file the pictures this actually happens to my colleague they got a software to scan the hard drive and the located those deleted files the contents are still there they just did the bad guy just to flip a few bits and if you flip those bit back you get the picture back I think the next move of the bad guy is they they will encrypt the file delete those files and then they will overwrite the free space of the heart on the hard drive which basically means they generate some random data to overwrite your picture that's deleted a picture so now the content are gone and you cannot just change the header file of the picture and save the file I don't know there it seems that there's no way of protecting your picture under this case so actually my colleague and I we discuss about it how can we actually guarantee the safety of the picture I think the best way is not to put the picture on your external hard drive but every three or four months you've got a writable DVD from whatever store I will not name any store because this is not an advertisement once we put this video online we cannot name any store because this is now that advertisement okay so you called any store you get those writable DVD and only red ones okay you put it in your computer and copy or write your pictures onto those right both DVD and that's it okay the DVD can be written for only once you copy the photo layer and that's it you're right a marker said okay my son six year old the picture nothing could happen to the DVD because the bad guy cannot write to it again because it's only one time writable there's no way you can write it a second time and they cannot re-encrypt those stuff it's much better than the hard drive because the hard drive the bad guy can break in and really encrypted a file okay I hope you enjoy this comment I provide this common file is longer than 15 minutes so I'm not quite sure whether or not the YouTube will allow me to upload as a single video as possible that we have to cut it into two pieces please shoot me an email if you have any comments for example if you say oh okay I like this this commenting way or oh I really do not enjoy your commenting or or just put your hands down don't wave your hands in the screen which detract me so let me know how I can improve thank you
