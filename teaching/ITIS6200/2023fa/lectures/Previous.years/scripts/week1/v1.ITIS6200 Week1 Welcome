good morning everyone and welcome to the ICIS 62 8200 principles of information security and privacy in the fall semester of 2023.

My name is cha WA and I will be the instructor of this course and this will be a fully online course so in the next 16 weeks well also I say 16 weeks the fall semester is kind of weird we have a lot of holidays and also breaks so our actual class time will be 14 and a half weeks so in the next of 40 and a half weeks we are going to try to cover the basic concepts of information security and the privacy.

You can imagine this is a very challenging task because when we consider how well or how broadly the information security and privacy have grown in the past ten years or so you can see it's almost impossible for us to introduce all basic crypto and maths as the foundation of the information security network security systems security application security web security you can name it ok so it's almost impossible at the same time there will be a lot of state-of-the-art topic that we try to cover for example Internet of Things security or digital currency for example what happens to Bitcoin and why the price of Bitcoin fluctuated so much ok we will try our best to cover some of the state-of-the-art topic as well so you can understand we will have to to do some choice and these cut some of the topics also we are very interested it and also they're very important okay so provide a feedback if you want to hear some topic and we will be happy to squeeze some in if possible at the same time you can imagine security is not some type of pure theoretical course it's not something we can totally deliver with a pen and a pencil this is not a theoretical physics okay so it's a very hands-on topic there will be project or programming small programming projects involved during this procedure okay and also class participation is very important so in the course syllabus you are going to see that we will need you to conduct some type of efforts in addition to the class time participation to the quiz to the homework and to the exam and projects we want to build something similar to a wiki page so that everybody can contribute at least of one topic related to information and security and privacy and share with the classmates and we will also require all the classmates to form small groups and generate a an educational video related to a security topic okay the detail the description are all in the course syllabus okay a little bit of myself my name is Chuang I graduated from Purdue University I have been conducting research in wireless network security cloud security internet-of-things security cyber physical systems security in all these years so it will be my pleasure to share some of my knowledge and the research efforts and also the latest papers that we see in those top security conference with the class ok and you can see I'm not a native English speaker so I have some accent based on previous feedback this has not been a serious problem that will impact your understanding of the course material but you if you feel there's something I can do to improve the course quality or the way with the lever the course don't hesitate to contact me ok so this is a welcome to our course and we will see each other very frequently in the next fourteen and a half weeks looking forward to work with you and we can grow together and explore together in the broad field of information security and privacy ok thank you so much and I have a great day
