okay so now let's go back to this hash function presentation and you can see on the screen now we have the three desired properties of a secure hash function the first property basically emphasized a hash function must be a one-way calculation procedure in other words everybody can hash that you cannot reverse the procedure I give you a hash without you will not be able to figure out what is the original string this is our original file this is very very important because only when we have this property it can prevent any of those manipulation attacked on the hash it out okay the second and the third properties they have some relation but actually the number three property is a little bit stronger than the second property the presenter actually discusses extensively in his later presentation and we're gonna discuss about it in our class so we don't intensively discussed it here okay this is on page six when the presenter said presenting how to break this hashing function there's nothing wrong in the slides but he presented in a very misleading way why basically he said I give you a hash and whether or not you can find a message with that will generated this hash and he's saying okay let's do brute-force attack which let's just to pick a random message hash it if you got a hit you're lucky you were not hit you don't get a hit try a different the message and here is what he's saying he said okay the best case is you're so lucky that the first amounts it or you try you get it correctly then you're good okay okay we're good you're I totally agree with it and then the worst case when he presented there's nothing wrong but it's just in a misleading way he said okay in the worst case you will find or other right now first because there are two ^ 128 a possible hazard out and you are looking for a specific one but unfortunately you don't find this one you want but you have everyone else you have everyone else okay there's nothing wrong but I just wanted you to understand that it does not guarantee that if you try to ^ 128 different messages you are going to find a hit you're going to find a hit Y it is not always true because okay it's very possible that while you try different the messages well you try different messages several of the messages that you try they have the same hash rate out those hash readout will fall into this - ^ 128 - one lunch so several messages they have the same hash rates out but those are not the result you are looking for it so you still do not have a hit but you is possible that you need to hash more than two to the power of 128 messages to actually find such a result okay this is just a misleading way I think the way that he is preventing it's a little bit misleading I won't clap okay here he talked about this birthday paradox this is a concept that is not very easy to understand but I will try my best ok this is actually related to the number two and the number three properties of the good hash function in the number two property it says okay I have a file it hash to this value you cannot find another file that hashing to this sub cific matter the property 3 is even stronger it says you cannot have you cannot find any two files or it's very difficult to find any two files that will have the same hash result okay what's the difference for the second property we are saying okay I have a value here this is a specific file hashing to a specific value okay and you try candidate file number one your hash it and see whether or not they have the same hash no they don't so I try candidate file number two whether or not they have the same hash no they don't now I try candidate a file number three so you can see this is actually like us it's more like a star shape so everyone is compared to this specific value this is property two and when you have n slides when I have n nodes let's go back to our original point so you'll have a specific value you are comparing and if you have n candidate files every candidate file is only compared to this specific value there's no relationship among those candidate files this is property two of a good hash function and what about property three property three said okay I have n files and a model and files you can files you cannot find any two file that having the same hash rate out now we're not talking about a star property every file compared to a single file we're talking about every file is comparing to every file so you can see now you have many many more edges because o in all the days where you have n candidate you only have n edges because every file is compared to this single specific value now if you have n candidate files every node is having a link with another node and then since we have n nodes and every node will have n minus one neighbors because there are the other n minus one nodes and you have a link to it you all together you are going have n times M minus 1/2 Y divided by 2 because the same edge will become by this guy and this guy every entry is counted by twice so you have roughly half of the N Squire number of edges that's why for this birthday paradox you need many much many many fewer notes to actually have to locate two files or two persons have the same birthday or two files having the same hash rate down so the third property is actually much stronger than the second the property of a good hash phone for this slides the presenter actually introduced three applications in area of good hash function which are all very very good examples the first one is to verify that you download the correct file if you look at many of many of this webpage these days are actually using this technique and the second the message authentication code is you can see is actually a keyed hash function so it depends on not only the hash calculation procedure but also a secret is shared between two parties so in this way the bad guy will not be able to impersonate or generate a message authentication code in other people's names in other people think and the password storage we're going to discuss actually we're gonna discuss this three examples in our class because I think those are the typical application scenario of good hash function and we're also going to introduce some other examples so I will see you in the class on this hash calculation topic because I believe hashes are very very important topic computer secured
