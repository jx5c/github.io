good morning everyone and welcome back to 6282 100 class and starting from today we're going to discuss some type of attack so we're especially interested in two types of attacks one is called forward search attack the other is called a man the middle okay both attacks have a very wide application in real life the bad guys have used similar attacks to compromise many different assistants that's why we need to introduce this attacks in detail okay so what is forward a search attack so let's give you an example and you will understand that what's going on okay and the from time to time the forest some people will say that forward a search attack it's a certain type of brute-force attack because you're basically trying every possible message under a certain key from this point of fuel the two types of tech have some similarity but after the example I think you will have a better understanding what's going on okay so let's see we have two person one is Alice the other is Donald Trump okay so let's say Donald Trump try to hide his real age I don't think he he he he yes but let's just give an example okay so Alice is Donald Trump's lawyer okay and Donald Trump is trying to hide his real age so Alice said Oh Donald I needed to file your text form for the 2015 I needed your birthday the don't from said sure I have my birthday but I could not transmit a lie in clear tags to because I don't want to do that Alice said let's go that's great it's fine I have a public key of Alice I have a private key of Alice okay so it's through some secure channel through some secure Channel Alice deliver her public key to Donald Trump and remember this public key is the real public key of Alice this is not the main tomato attack which the bad guy could replace Alice's public key so let's say this is the real public key of Alice and the only one who can open a message encrypted by this public key will be Alice who holds the corresponding private key so Alice said Oh Tom don't why don't you just send me your birthday encrypted by the public key and then I will be able to figure it out and Donald Trump said sure thing so this meant this message is for Alice this message is for Donald Trump and the inside I have a public key encryption message encrypted by the public key of Alice and of course is months months they day and God forbid year year okay fantastic we have a message okay now let's look at this message and the messenger being encrypted by the public key of Alice only when you have the private key of Alice you will be able to open this message and of course some eavesdropper some if chopper who belongs to Donald Trump's competitors team we cannot name the name because this because the if topper is going to do something bad okay the hiding the age it's totally understandable okay so we have a eavesdropper leaf dropper trying to figure out Donald Trump's real age and he will sell this message to some newspaper said Oh Donald Trump is actually 130 years old so he should not be the president okay of course the if dropper will be able to somehow magically get a hold on the internet connection and may be able to Eve to have on the packet okay so the bad guy will get a copy of this packet but of course he will not be able to get a hold of the private key of Alice and we have shown in previous homework that if we choose very long public and private key it will take this guy forever to compromise it it's practically impossible for you to do anything to compromise this so it's impossible if you want to try brute force attack okay so what we'll do if dropper to the lift Oprah will contact Alice said Alice you're a lawyer right and I said yes I am I needed some help to file the you know text form could you help me Alice said of course I will help you you know this is business business is business so Alice said okay here is my public key of Alice here is my public key of Alice and you know if you want to communicate which means securely just you know use the public key to encrypt the message I will be able to receive it I will be able to use the corresponding private key to open it up fantastic so now the bad guy will get a copy of the public key of Alice and the then the bad guy will be able to conduct this forward search attack okay I needed to eliminate some part from the thicker so that I will have enough space to write down what need to write okay so it's still youth drop hurt so now let's see what the bad guy will do okay we know that a person's a each so let's say a person's a person's age let's say is from 0 to 200 years old I have never met anyone who is older than 20 years old if you have please let me know I will be a so let's say is from 0 to 200 years old and you know exactly what date is today so you will be able to generate all possible date from today to 200 years beforehand from today to 200 years beforehand and we believe that this Donald Trump's birthday will fall into this category okay from today and you go backwards for 200 years I believe that Donald Trump was born on one of this day okay so now let's see how many possible dates are there how many possible dates are there oh so we have 365 days per year times 200 years well this is not really a very large number you can tell this is roughly I think if my math is correct so you have about 73,000 the possible days and then what will be the bad guy - the bad guy will do date 1 encrypted with the public key of Alice date 1 and then date 2 encrypted public key of Alice date - so low and so forth you have d7 300 and you have E public key of Alice date 73 ok so now what will act the eavesdropper actually do the each dropper will generate all possible date of donald trump's birthday and he will generate a huge table on the left side on the left side at the left-sided column will be all the possible dates on the right side that will be the encryption result of the possible date okay remember the public key of alice's public which means which means that you've dropped her will get a copy of the public key and then he can do whatever he wants and he can encrypt all the possible message as many message as he wants okay so this will be the this will be the table so he will build a big table which containing 73 thousand countries and then what will he do he will compare one country by country in the right side to the eve drop packet to the eavesdrop packet why because Dalton was born on a specific day so his birthday will have a Muslim state a year year year year which we use the same format here so if one of the date is the same ethylic Trump's birthday okay and then we will be able to see the two messages are exactly the same the if dropped a message and the one message in our huge table they're going to be equally the same and then what will that youth dropper to the Youth dropper we'll look at the left aside there is a date there's a date and that that date will be the original message will be the original message okay so I hope you understand this example of for a search attack and then let's take a look and what happened okay so I have to remove it so that buy us some space okay so let's go back so now we know that the bad guy can conduct this forward a search attack and the first question we need to mean is does this mean the bad guy compromised asymmetric encryption so does this mean that the bad guy actually compromised a synchronized encryption no no okay so this attack has nothing to do with the strengths of the public key encryption so the bad guy is active actually not trying to compute the private key on the contrary in to take advantage of some weak point in the design the policy in the design the protocol okay so let's look at the problem let's look at the problem so you can see when I look at this message when I look at the message so the first problem is there are a limited number of possible messages the first thing is there are a limited number of possible messages certificate if eclis in this example since we believe every human being who is alive is younger than 200 years old actually I could I can probably shrink it to 100 but let's say it's 200 years old and we only got 73 thousand possible messages you could say 73 sound and a possible message it is pretty large I agree with you however when we consider the computation capability of the computers it's really a small number second the bad guy can do exactly the same operation that the good guy can do let's come back second the bad guy can do exactly the same operation that the good guy can do in this sub cific example is the encryption of a message with the public key of balance and here the bad guy could his hands over the public key of alice okay actually he will be able to get a copy of the public key because it's a public and then he will be able to incorrect as many message as he wants okay so because of these two problems the bad guy will be able to conduct the man the middle a forward search attack okay if you want to say this is a brute-force attack I guess you could so it's um say a brute-force attack is more like an example like you go to a hotel room and you'll see the safe in the hotel and you know it's a four digit PIN and you're going to try every possible 42 PN and open it so from this point of view the two types of tag has some similarity and some similarity okay so if you want to say that this folded search attack is a certain type of booth was well I guess you could but we don't compare this with the you know try all the possible 42 the pin of the hotel safe you can still taste it this is a little bit different this is a little bit different okay so of course when we say there is a limited a number of possible messages there are actually two things we need to consider okay one is how to say one is real limited the other is your radical eliminated it's a radical element in it and this is really bad why so in our example we have 73,000 this is pretty small number and it's your radical eliminated we know that oh you know if I'm just encrypt a 128-bit key if I'm just encrypt a 128-bit key with the public key of Alice and about the Donald Trump send this to Alice this is a limited number of message right this is only 2 ^ 128 so you can still do this forward search attack the only thing is you need to generate all possible 128-bit Ravel and ink remove its public key and compare them very well see erratically you can do that but based on a previous example your homework you already know that 2 to the power of 1 point a is a little bit too big so if you generate all the possible key and encrypt every key with the public key of Alice you will not be able to finish even if your lifetime is 200 years old actually based on the number you see the number is huge even when the solar system claps you'll still cannot finish it okay so be very very careful of when there is a limited number of message what do we really need okay so let's have a similar open question to end this session on this foreign search attack a we have generated a similar question so let's say still we have two persons we have Alice in the Bob Alice is stock manager who helped other people to Vienna sell stock to invest basically it's an investment counselor and Bob is a customer but it's a customer so so bob has a special type of algorithm and the Bob can predict tomorrow which two stocks which two stocks will increase the most so god forbid let's say bob has this SuperDuper capability and then every morning Bob will send a message to Alan said hey Alice I want you to buy this two stocks for me today and when it reached the highest value just as seldom okay and of course we have that Youth dropper the if dropper go to Bob's and HIPAA can you tell me which two stocks will you know increase the most tomorrow well I know I don't tell the secret so if Tom tried to figure out the message okay and of course Alice has the public key of Alice and private key o ballots and private key of Alice and the Alice knows exactly that how valuable this information is so Alice will give the public key of herself to Bob and ask her Bob to encrypt the message and then sent to her so every morning Bob will select tooth doc stock one stock - and we know that every stock has a nickname of four I believe it's a one to four character name when you buy in a cell for example I believe Google is Gog okay so basically if Baba want Alice to buy Google for him it was then a goog and to the math in the message and then another one let's say it's he want Alice to buy Citi group for him and I assume that I forget but that's let's let's say the seat is cold it's C okay because C D it's very early so it can occupy those faster code okay so this is C so Bob will put the Google and the Citibank in the message and the Senate to Alice and every stock is represented by the code on Wall Street okay and now the if dropper will be able to eavesdrop on this message the question is how can the eavesdropper figure out which stocks Alice will buy for Bob today the first question is how second so let us assume that there are four thousand stocks on the market I don't know how many are there there is probably more than four sounded so let's say there are four thousand different stocks my question is how many different the message how many different the message that's e eavesdropper needs to encrypt to accomplish this for a search attack so this will be like a take-home question and you can work on after watching this video okay I will see you in the next video thank you
