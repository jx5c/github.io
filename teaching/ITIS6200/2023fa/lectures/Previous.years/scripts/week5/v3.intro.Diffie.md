hello so in this video I wanted to talk about the diffie-hellman protocol Nativity Hellman protocols basically it's really amazing result just a phenomenal result in the area of cryptography that really is enabled a lot of the commerce that we see today online so this is called a diffie-hellman protocol and actually even though it's typically called Tiffany Hellman there's also a fellow at name of Ralph Merkle who was involved in some of the key ideas that they led to the protocol so some people like to give him credit along with the protocol called the diffie-hellman Merkle protocol although typically when you look online you view most you'll see this protocol associated with just Diffie and Hellman and this protocol was actually invented in the late seventies 1976 or so and his protocol ended up inspiring other work so for example the diffie-hellman protocol was the inspiration for the the RSA protocol and RSA in fact and diffie-hellman and a bunch of these protocols were eventually implemented within another protocol called SSL and SSL is really it's not a Secure Sockets Layer this is you know so the protocol that that allowed ecommerce to happen this is really just you know we did this in many ways was the the enabler for e-commerce in fact when you go to a site like Amazon calm and tells you you know there's a lock icon on the browser window and it says that your transaction is secure it's because of these schemas because of tiffin helmet and RSA that they can say that and really what these protocols were designed to do they were designed to allow two parties and typically in the literature we we call them Alice and Bob we will simply say Alice involves with they allow two parties Alice and Bob to agree on a secret keys let's say if not Alice involved and allow them to agree on a shared secret a shared value from the two of them even if they're communicating over a channel that can be eavesdrop upon and imagine you have you have a third party let's call it Eve and this is what you typically see a crypto if you can listen in and then the magician's better let's give her some ears let's say Eve's a really good listener and that's such a baby there were some features too some here let's say Eve is a really good listener and she's listening you can listen to everything the Alice and Bob are saying Allison Bob would have to be really careful be very hard for Allison Bob to come up with a shared secret because let's say that if Bob came up with a secret value they could use and he tried to just send it to Alice then Eve would listen to that and then know their shared secret and likewise if Alice tried to do the same thing and send a secret over to Bob um again you could listen so you might be wondering how is it possible for them for Alice and Bob to communicate over the Internet where Eve can hear everything and somehow at the end of that communication come up with a secret key and it turns out - do you stay the way this was solving this is just a brilliant idea was to use some ideas from modular arithmetic so here's kind of a set up behind diffie-hellman the diffie-hellman protocol so we're gonna have everybody have two parameters we're going to call them G and P okay now P is a prime number and if you recall what's a prime number a prime number is basically any number whose divisors are just one in itself so and that just basically means a prime number means it's only dividers only divisors are one and P so for example the numbers 2 3 5 7 and so on these are all prime numbers okay 13 11 13 etc and in in the case of diffie-hellman you actually need to pick a large prime number so you like to be the large prime number and by large we typically mean something on the order of about 600 digits okay 600 digits or so the bigger the prime number in this case that the more secure the protocol is we're talking about you about security in this is first video I'd take the element but I will touch upon that subsequently but you need a pretty large prime number around 600 digits now G is just basically going to be a number between two and P minus two okay and and really we actually need you to be a generator for the group Z mod p or ZP star but won't even go into that for now for it suffice to say I just just think of it as a random number for now between 2 and P minus 2 okay and we're gonna will add some properties of you ultimately but the way that the the set up goes is Alice is going to do the following alice is going to pick a number a call it a lowercase a and let's say a is gonna be an element of what we call ZP stars picked at random and ZP star all this - this is just fancy notation for she's gonna pick some number between 0 and P minus 1 okay and I know this might sound a bit abstract you what I will do is after this video I'll do another video where I'll actually walk through a numerical example of diffie-hellman for now let me kind of give you the abstract notation try to make of it of what you will and then I will do will do a concrete example subsequent to that ok and let's talk about what Alice gonna next alice is going to compute basically a public value I'm going to call a capital A for Alice and this public value will basically be generator G that we talked about up here raised to be eighth power mod P you know the generator and the prime the G and the P here these are actually going to be public everyone's going to know them ok this is public information ok but the only secret here is going to be this value a for Alice nobody knows lowercase a except for Alice and Alice is going to send this uppercase the uppercase value a to Bob ok so what is Bob going to do well Bob is going to compute his own value let's call this value lowercase B and he's can also I'm going to pull it from ZP star ok and recall as I said previously that Z B starts basically just in this case this number that's the numbers from 0 to P minus 1 okay and Bob is going to compute a value and we're going to call that upper case B an upper case B will be equal to G to the lower case B mod P ok and then Bob is going to send this upper case B to Alice so just point what is alice is going to have upper case B Bobby gonna have an upper case a Alice is also going to know some of the material to be generated Bob will know about lower case B as well and I claim at this point but Alice and Bob have enough information to generate a shared value written two of them and and then we'll stop we'll talk about why that share value might be something that even have a hard time figuring out but if you want you might want to as I explained this you might want to kind of periodically pause to see if you can figure out the rest of the steps on your order I think this is a good way to learn math in general don't just kind of sit there passively as I explain everything you but try to pause along the way and see if you can figure things out on your own before you see how I might do them okay so with that let me explain to you how Alice will come up with her portion of the shared secret what Alice is gonna basically do is you know she will take her her value uppercase I'd rather she's gonna actually first take the value that Bob gave her which is lowercase sorry about that she's gonna first sickly be value that that Bob gave her which is upper case B okay and she's going to race upper case B ^ lower case a no and she knows lower case a already okay because that's the belly she came up with now let's thing on what that's gonna give her so upper case B to the lower case a well if you think about it upper case B was just G to the B right mod P okay and now we're gonna raise that to the 8th power and if you recall the video on on modular arithmetic I did talk about the idea that basically when you do arithmetic modulo and any number it kind of preserves the regular properties arithmetic so um you know G to the B mod P to the a is basically going to be equal to this section this is gonna be equal to G to the B to the a mod P which is back I'm also going to be equal to G to the DA Marquis and that's because when you take something of a palm-tree to the band right she did the p.m. braces at the 8th power you get G to the B a because the exponents basically multiply and it's kind of a standard property of regular exponentiation now Bob in turn what can he compute well Bob is is gonna know he's gonna have in fact movie um you can pause her to see if you can figure out how Bob would come up with the same value but if you want you to spoiler Bob knows capital a because he's giveth he's gotten that from Alice right Alice gave him this value okay he's gonna be he's gonna raise this value to the lowercase B because he knows lowercase B since he in fact generated lowercase B so what is uppercase a to the lowercase B well that's gonna be equal to uppercase they was G to the a right so that was equal to G to the a and now when you raise that to the B power you get G to the a B I can't remember we're doing all this modulo P and it's it's obviously since multiplication is a commutative operator I'm you can change the order around and slope at the same value in this particular case and there are groups in which multiplication might not be defined it's commutative but we won't consider that for now but for now you see that Alice has due to the B MRP Bob as G to the a B mod p and so they actually have a common value they actually know the same thing they both have this value huge which it turns out to be the exact same thing okay so now Alison Bob been able to compute a combined value that's the same but what is Eve know what does Eve see no Eve okay her view of the world is she's seen all he's seen over the network she seen capital a and she seen capital B okay now capital a we're just she sees she today and she sees G to the B but what she hasn't seen is she hasn't actually seen G to the a B and it turns out that if you pick a big enough prime and you pick a suitable value for G and there are ways in which to do that and I won't go into all those details right now it's very hard from G to the ancient the B to just figure out in G to the a B the reality is it's it's not like Eve doesn't know lowercase C over lowercase B she's only seeing the uppercase a uppercase B she's not seeing the lowercase values and there's just at this point in terms of a number theory or the computational number three the field of photography no one knows how to compute G to the a B gives you things e to the B for suitable choices of JP and and that's been a major open problem if you have any success in being able to solve it it would be you know instant PhD thesis instant fame in the cryptography community but today today it's been now well over I think about 35 or years and no one has been able to figure out how to actually crack this problem of coming up with you to a B given G to the AG to the B but now this is pretty amazing because M is listened to everything that was going on in this protocol she's been a public party being able to eavesdrop on everything but at the same time she doesn't know at all what they shared secret that Alice and Bob were able to come up with because she's only seen these two public values she hasn't seen the corresponding secret values but because really Alice and Bob each team with one portion to see her on their own and shared some public values they were able to effectively take their respective secret and the other person's public value and combine it both installed in different ways but to arrive at the the ultimately the same shared secret which is G to the AV here okay so they were both able to come up with G to the a B but Eve has no information no way of actually doing that based on the current state of the art so I'm going to stop here and I'm going to continue and talk in future videos about diffie-hellman some more thanks a lot and I look forward to seeing you in the next video
