welcome back and in this video we are going to explain this Merkle's puzzle in a little bit of different way I got feeling that the original video that we post there seems to have the tradition or trend to explain something in a more formal in the complicated way so we will try to provide an intuitive version of this concept of mirko's puzzle okay before we go to the details of Markos puddle let me give you a not so loud not so nice real-life example and please do not do this in real life okay so let's say we are parents and the kid want to want to have a big set of Lego for the Christmas presents so it's very expensive so we're not very happy so we decided to cause some trouble for the kids so here is what we do we purchase the big set of Lego and we put it in a box wrap it up at the same time we buy another salt in the box which is look exactly the same as the thread in the wrapped box and we wrapped a one-celled in the Box in the same way and we may put some sand in it so that the weight are roughly the same the way it is roughly the same so now on the Christmas Day and the kid comes down from the fairs and he or she will see one salt in the box which look exactly the same which would look exactly the same and here we tell him or her that okay one of the box contains the Lego set you want the other 999 they are just empty boxes so what can the kid - the kid can to the most straightforward way is I'm going to destroy all 1000 box okay so let's say he or she needs one minute to open a box so he or she open a box Wow no before that let's say he or she first soared those went out in the box put the one thought in the Box you know straight line okay and then he randomly picks one and it used one minute to open the box and then he says it oh it's the sand it does not contain my Lego set so he dumps it and now he faced a problem so let's say we have one sound in the box and I pick one somewhere in this line and open it it does not contain the thing I want so my question is this result you pick something in between does this provide you any further information for the next of depth search in other words I pick someone here in this line and I failed does this suggest I should search in the front half I mean before the box I already opened or after it does not actually provide any of such hint or any information okay so this is different from if you have if you remember when you take the algorithm course or programming course we teach something called a binary search remember that in binary search every time when you pick a number or a box even if you fail you will know that you need to look in the first half or the second half under that case every time your search space will be halved so you actually only need a log n times to get what you want on the contrary in this Merkel's paddle or units can open Christmas present example there is absolutely no such information so you open a box you failed you have nine hundred ninety nine bucks left you have no idea where you should go so what's your faster strategy you'll still randomly pick one open it run so you keep trying until you succeed until you succeed okay so the best case for the kid is he will open one and he is lucky enough he got the Lego box the worst case is the first and 999 are off ten and the last one will be the Lego and statistically you needed to open about half of the boxes to actually see your present so that's roughly 500 okay so that is case very similar to the Merkel's paddle so now let's go back to this Merkel's puzzle so if you look in its slides every puzzle that don't burn a prison here is like a box it's like a box that we just a present okay within the box there is something valuable and a little bit of different from this kids open box example now we have three parties instead two parties okay in the kids opening box example we only have two parties you and the kid now we have the sender the receiver and the bad guy the bad guy is more like the kid in our proud and opening example okay so now you generate one-celled in the box every box is a puzzle every box is a puzzle okay to open any specific box you need a certain amount of effort for example you need your computer to calculate for two hours to open this box since this box is just an encrypted message and since the key only contain a certain number of bits and here in this example they said okay it's a certain two-bit key you can choose different the length of the key depending on how long the key is it will require different amount of effort to open the box so for example if it's a four digit box you probably need a ten minute to open it if it's 64 bits you probably need one day okay you get my you got the idea for any specific puzzle let's say you need a two hour to open it and you generate a 1000 of those puzzles and dump of them to the receiver and the receiver will randomly pick one box spend two hours to open it and within the box there is no Lego set on the contrary there is a key which we are going to use to encrypt the information and also there is an indexed number there's an index number okay so so if you look at this slice you will notice that obtained XJ and the KJ here XJ is an index number this index number actually at the sender will maintain a table in her database on the left hand side the table contained entry contains the index number on the right side it contains a key value so if you tell me what is the index number I can easily see the key value okay here you got to be very very careful okay actually done balance video he explained he said both the key and the sequence number or the index number are 128 bits random number okay here if you look at it you got to be very very careful that this X I should not represent the position of the key in this table for example you cannot say that okay I have the k1 k2 all the way to your k1000 since we have 1000 boxes so then the X I the index number will be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and t1000 and we have this 128-bit key k1 k2 all the way to okay 1000 why do you want why shouldn't you do that because if you do that and if you stand those boxes in order from the number 1 to 1000 okay and then later when the receiver open a box let's say he opens the box 728 and then the return index value of XJ will be 726 if you are also sending this once out in the box in order the bad guy will understand which box I should pick okay you don't want the bad guy to have the capability to map this index number to a corresponding box okay that's why here temporary use a plea extreme solution the XJ the index number and the K the key they're all random 128 bits value okay so later when the retailer Bob opening opens a random box and he will gather the key KJ and he will return this index number XJ to Alice Alice will look at the table that she maintained in her database and the locator the corresponding XJ value and on the right side there's a k KJ this one will be the secret key being used to between the two parties now let's look at it the bad guy the bad guy will if drop on all the boxes the one southern box okay for every box he need a 2-hour to open it okay so he randomly picked one box open it and a look at the index number and the K the index number is not XJ so it's not the key is not the box that Bob chooses to open so what the bad guy can do now the bad guy has 999 box in front of him and based on the open the box he cannot determine should I look in the front side or the back side so I do not get any knowledge about that so what's my best of strategy of the bad guy I would run the me pick another box and try to open it I open it it's still not what can I do open the next one okay just as the kids opening the present box example theoratically on average the bad guy need to try half of those paddles to actually see the secret key selected by Bob and here we can control the total number of puddle and the amount of time that you need to spend to open a specific puddle and together we can control our average how long that key will be secured for example if for every puddle you need 2 hours to open and I give you one celled in the puddle theoretically on average you need to open 500 of them to our each 500 boxes on average you will need 2 hours times 500 which you will need a thousand hours to open to find the key I'm going to use that is roughly equal to 40 days so let's say I'm going to use that key for only today and whatever information I encrypt will be valuable only in the next 2 days for example I'm predicting what will be the stock market look like in 2 days is it going up or going that's how I can make profit so this piece of information will be only valuable for the next two days because two days later the market will do whatever it does and by that time it will be too late for you to jump into the market and make a profit so if you have to spend 1,000 hours and we know that every day we have 24 hours so that's roughly equal to a 40 day period of time so if you can decode my secret in 40 days is totally useless because in 2 days you're going to see the result and you can decode the result in 40 days it's totally useless to you ok so we are giving we give an example we said it for every puddle you need 2 hours and we give you one southern puddles and in this specific video for every puddle they used a 32-bit key and also they use a 2 to the power of 32 boxes that's why here he said Alice's work is at the level of M because it's a 32-bit key to answer a let's generate 2 to the power of 32 boxes at the same time Bob needed to open a single box and he needed to try all possible 32-bits key also he's workload is 2 to the power of 32 and that that's where for the if job hers work the if job her needs to try to open every box and the for every box he need a 2 to the power of 32 and there are 2 to the power 32 boxes that's where the 2 to the power of 64 comes from ok and I hope this video helped you to clarify or to understand better of this Merkel's puzzle thanks
