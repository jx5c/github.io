good morning everyone and welcome back to the 60 to 100 class in the week six we post the three videos on the public key infrastructure to of videos are from the training sessions of a company which are relatively short it's about 15 to 18 minutes which I believe you can stay focused here on the screen you can see this is the first video we posted it's about a PKI concept and now is it about a 4 minute 40 minutes and if you look at here this is the first time the lady introduced how the PGI works and in her slides the user here labelled as you will ask the CA for the public key certificate of Alice okay we want just to emphasize one thing and I believe we emphasize this you know classroom the certificate does not have to come from CA or come from the owner itself it's possible that we have a certain party surface provider and the providers responsibility is Justin to collect a whole lot of certificate from different users and the put it in the repository and they provided a surface if you want somebody's certificate I will provide it to you free or with a small amount of charge so this will be like a certificate a server so okay so here we come back to one thing okay what actually guaranteed the safety the authenticity and the integrity of this certificate it is the CAS digital signature the safety of the certificate does not come from the source so whoever give you a certificate okay I can hand you over a certificate of Bank of America okay what make it the Bank of America certificate it is the easiest digital signature okay so I'm not pretending to be POA but I can hand you over a certificate of BOE you just need to verify the signature if it passed a verification then this is real and whatever containing in that certificate it is BOS public key and then whoever knows the corresponding private key is Bo a it does not matter he's beautiful or his handsome or his shortest tour as long as he knows the private key that is BankAmerica okay so be very very careful about this part here we're at about eight minutes of the video and in her video she mentions that you know when you try to request a certificate there are two ways so one is you can after the CA to generate the public/private key pair and it will sign the public key and give you the certificate another way is you generated a public key yourself and submitted a public key to the certificate authorities through a secure channel and the CA will sign the certificate and in her video she mentions that it is safer for you to generate the key by yourself then to let the CA to generated the key I'm not quite sure about this because key generation is a more complicated problem than you think and especially here we are talking about the public/private key pair we are not talking about a symmetric key so if we're talking about a cementery the key then you can probably find a perfectly fair coin if you want 128-bit key you just to flip your coin 128 times that's okay when we talk about a public/private key pair it's a separate issue you cannot adjust to flip a coin 29:28 times or here you cannot just flip the coin 2048 times why you can flip the coin 2048 times it will generate a random beat a string okay but how can you guarantee there is a corresponding private key mapping to this public key or vice-versa okay it's different from a symmetric key encryption algorithm so it's really hard to say which way is safer you generate your key by yourself or you go to some special agency or a special company that have the expertise to generate the key from my point of view I would rather go to somebody that has this expertise so I just want to make sure you understand this concern I have here for her video here we are at the second video that we post this is if you look at the top of the screen is PKI implementation so this is actually the second video that we post so I have two comments for this video first now we are at about the time of three minutes and 54 seconds in this video and it introduces slides about internal certificate authority and I would recommend you to listen to this page for more than one time because it contains a lot of information and at the same time she presented this part of relatively fast so my recommendation for you is to from here for the next three or four minutes I would recommend you to listen to this or watch this for more than once okay and here we are at about 15 minutes 44 seconds and she is introducing different trust models that the CAS can use and here you can see they have they have two big organizations and each organization construct its own see a hierarchy and the two organizations obviously do not trust each other too much that's why they needed to go through this bridge CA or they will mutually certify each other so that the notes from organization a can communicate with the organization or some agency organization B so they can mutually certify each other's certificate or public key so this has a lot of issues or scenarios in real life that actually work like this for example we can never imagine USA and the Russian will trust at the same CA you can never have a tree that put Russian and United States under the same tree and they will trust each other because both countries will try to control the root CA and then will succeed in they will have to go into a architecture or something like this similarly Microsoft and Apple probably will not trust each other to use that same root CA they will also go through something like this okay so there are many real-life examples we need this type of solution here
