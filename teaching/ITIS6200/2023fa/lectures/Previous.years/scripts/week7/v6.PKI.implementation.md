hello and welcome to the lesson PKI implementation you're watching the CompTIA security plus training course and I'm your instructor Lisa Spooner we have already covered the terms and concepts of public key infrastructure now let's look at the basics for PKI implementation because there is a long list of what PKI can do for us we can utilize it to authenticate the identities of parties in a transaction verify the integrity of messages ensure the privacy of sensitive information authorized access if digital certificates are being used as login credentials and support non-repudiation PKI keys can even be attached to smart cards so in this lesson we're going to look at publicly trusted certificate authorities versus internal certificate authorities also working with registration authorities key management certificate management and Trust models the trust models we're going to look at are hierarchical bridge mesh and hybrid the exam objective for this lesson is six point four which says implement PKI certificate management and associated components let's get started when you are using a publicly trusted certificate authority it means that a trusted third-party issues and signs your digital certificate when we say trusted third-party we mean that it's already trusted by web browsers and other applications the means that you already have a copy of their cert and public key in the list of trusted certs in your browser kind of like I showed you for the certificate for train signal comm except that copies of the certificates for certificate authorities are in the trusted root store in your browser sometimes TTP's will provide personal certificates for no cost but SSL certs for websites come with a price tag and some common commercial TTP's are Verisign GoDaddy and didja cert if you have a public-facing website you really do need a cert from a trusted third-party when customers visit websites with self-signed cert they get warning messages and need to go through a number of steps to get their browsers to trust that website this could be confusing or alarming so the pros to choosing a TTP to issue your cert instead of creating your own is that browsers and other applications already trust them like I said and when you purchase an SSL certificate from them your certificate will be trusted then as well this works both ways browsers will automatically trust the SSL cert and will automatically untrust it when the time comes like if your certificate becomes expired or sullied for some reason then the TTP will put your SSL cert on there publicly available certificate revocation lists and that information is spread to the different web browsers now the con is that as you start needing multiple certificates the cost can quickly add up if you want to set up digital certificates for every employee to use for internal email you really should consider internal certificate authorities instead of paying for all those certs now the other option is setting up internal certificate authorities this is used for intranets and other internal uses like hard drive and file encryption digitally signing documents authentication and internal email pros are the lower cost and the greater flexibility and control if you plan ahead creating your own public key infrastructure can be scalable and secure but this isn't easy the big con is the intensive management overhead for key and certificate management and other considerations like configuring and troubleshooting support for the different protocol systems and applications that exist at your company or deciding what trust model to use and its scalability and working out interoperability with business partners there are third-party options for creating your own CAS but the ability to provide CAS and public key infrastructure services is included with server operating systems Microsoft certificate services offers two options standalone CAS and Enterprise CAS in the world of Windows a standalone CA is not the same thing as a single CA trust model that we'll talk about a little later in the lesson instead it refers to a CA structure that does not need Active Directory to function so that means there still can be subordinate CAS again we'll talk about that in a minute on the other hand Enterprise CAS rely on Active Directory for its directory services and Enterprise CAS even have nifty templates that make creating certs easier using Active Directory allows certs to be linked to domain user accounts and allows the CRL to be published and disseminated using Active Directory which is fine if your internal public key infrastructure is only used in-house and you don't need to publish your crl publicly or for business partners like a public trusted third-party CAS need to do depending on your needs both kinds can exist within one organization for example you can have an internal enterprise hierarchy for internal users and a standalone system that is used for extra debts and business partners that don't have accounts within your Active Directory or using different directory services now let's talk about working with registration authorities remember an RA is responsible for identification and authentication of certificate owners but does not sign or issue certificates and for the case of large internal CA hierarchies they often function as a way to physically verify user credentials in person so what happens when we have multiple locations for one company does a new employee need to drive across the country to show their ID and get their digital certificate that's where the local Registration Authority comes in handy as you can see this new employee presents her credentials to the local Registration Authority who verifies them and sends the request to the remote CA to issue the cert next topic is some implementation considerations for key management key management needs to be incorporated into the security policy if you're going to set up your own certificate authorities one thing to think about is key generation and signing there can be centralized key generation where the keys are created and stored by the CA this offers the ease of centralized management and the ability to backup keys but backing up Keys can be a security vulnerability in itself if it's not done securely the alternative is decentralized key generation here the key pair is created by the user and then submitted to the CA to sign the ca does not keep a copy of the keys so this allows the key owner to have the only copy whatever the method for key generation it needs to be done in a secure manner choosing a good algorithm and a long key size and the private keys need to be distributed to the owners in a way that they are not lost or modified during distribution another point for key management is where and how the key repository will be maintained because remember public keys and the certificates can be centrally located in a repository for ease of use if you're using an enterprise window CA then the repository is located within your LDAP directory we also need to think about key recovery and like with all the backup situations we need to prepare this ahead of time so we aren't scrambling when something happens securely backup keys using key archiving tools these can be configured to automatically backup your keys have a key recovery policy and assign users to be recovery agents they will get special recovery agent certificates in your policy you want to specify what's called M of n control we don't just want one person responsible for key recovery for two reasons one they could abuse this power and two what if they are unavailable that's where M of N comes in M number of employees out of n number of recovery agents needs to be involved in key recovery this is separation of duties an example so if we make five employees recovery agents we can configure it so that three of them need to be present to recover a lost private key so that would be three out of five M out of N when it comes to certificate management we need to start with the discussion of policies and procedures how certificates are created handled needs to be in line with the organization's overall security policy the security policy would let users know where they need to use PKI certificates and what the benefits are by doing so starting here there are two types of documents that need to be written by the IT department along with help from legal and HR first is a certificate policy a certificate policy focuses on certificates and the CAS responsibilities regarding these certificates it defines the intended purpose of the certs the criteria and steps for certificate enrollment issuing usage renewal and archiving policies and perhaps most importantly what a user must do if their keys are lost compromised the second type of document is called a certificate practice statement or CPS these are derived directly from certificate policies and turn the policies into operational procedures like the procedures or policies for issuing renewing and recovering certificates or what algorithms are used in the key length requirement important note if a PKI provider does not have these documents available you should not use that provider let's look at the certificate and key life cycle the first step is for a user to request a digital certificate that binds the public private key pair to that user a request is sent to the RA or directly to the CA if the RA doesn't exist some systems allow keys and certificates to be revalidated before they expire in this case a renewal request must be made prior to the existing certificates expiration in either case the requesters identity is verified if everything checks out the next step is to issue the certificate a key pair is generated using the algorithm and parameters spelled out in the certificate practice statements and then the corresponding cert is created signed and sent to the requester the creation can then be used by its owner but only for the reason that it was issued for until it expires or is revoked for some reason if the private key is compromised the owner is obligated to notify the CA and this obligation may be written in the formal certificate practice statement it's so important I'm going to say it again the user must notify the CA or RA immediately if private key was lost or compromised the expired or if it's compromised revoked certificate is placed on the certificate revocation list crl is published and the information is disseminated now key destruction is permanently removing keys and certificates that are no longer needed this is so they can't be used by attackers for impersonation hopefully we are absolutely sure that the key isn't going to be needed to decrypt anything before we destroy it really only the private key needs to be deleted the public key is probably in a lot of different places and is useless without the private counterpart in the world of PKI Trust is the concept of confidence in the certs that a CA signs for an application or device to trust a certificate the issuing certificate authority must also be trusted now to know if this is true that app or device looks at its list or store of trusted certs if the CA is included then we're good or even if we trust that CAS CA or further up the chain PKI is very flexible and it can be implemented differently with different trust models the simplest trust model is a single CA this is a small PKI implementation with only one root certificate authority and that root CA signs its own certificate the hierarchical trust model is a top-down trust structure the higher CA sign the certificates of their subordinate CA is below them if we look at this diagram we can see a hierarchical or a tree or what sometimes called a distributed trust model the root authority is meant to be the most trusted type of CA in an organization's PKI typically both the physical security and a certificate policy of a root CA are the most rigorous than those for subordinate CAS if the root CA is compromised or issues a certificate to an unauthorized entity then any certificate based security in your organization is suddenly vulnerable a root CA can issue certs to users but most often they only issues to subordinate CAS who will then do the user or computer level cert issuing so a subordinate CA is one that's had its cert issued by another CA at your organization subordinate CAS can also issue certs for more subordinate CAS also say these two CAS here they end up with a cross certificate trust relationship this guy trusts this guy and vice-versa because they both trust the root CA that certified them certain subordinate CAS are called intermediate CAS if there are more subordinates under them and when we start to get chains of CAS like this the lowest ones can be referred to as lief CAS so these guys down here are both lief CAS and subordinate CAS and these here are both subordinate and intermediate now like this one here any of these Leafs can actually be an RA instead of a CA another term you may hear is issuing CA that is used to describe the CA that does the actual issuing of the certificates to the computers or users for email for authentication or for their smart cards another possibility is the mesh trust model here two-way trusts happen between all the CAS and that two-way trust is called a cross certification in the mesh model each CA is both the root and the subordinate so in this diagram we can see a cross certified mesh or what's sometimes called a network trust model and this is also how peer-to-peer trusts work pairs of CAS establish cross certification relationships and this relationship gets its own cross certificate and for this to work each user only needs to verify a single cross certificate and then all of the other certs from any of the other CAS can be trusted this is fine for small organizations but does not scale well to a large number of CAS there's also the bridge trust model or a cross certification trust exists between two hierarchical pkas with the bridge model one or more bridge CAS exists that set up that cross certification relationship between the PKI implementations this is great for establishing interoperability between organizations like in an e-commerce b2b environment that's business-to-business and the last trust model we're going to talk about is a hybrid trust model this is a mix of two or more different models for the most flexible structure you need to be careful when planning a hybrid model because that flexibility can easily lead to chaos and we've reached the key terms you should know section for this lesson I have two slides for you the first page has some assorted new terms that we learned regarding PKI implementation and the second is the different trust models that we discussed in this lesson so what should we cover in this short PKI implementation lesson while we started with talking about publicly trusted certificate authorities these will sell you certificates that are already trusted by web browsers and are vital for publicly facing websites the alternative is setting up your own internal certificate authority if you're going to set up your own PKI in-house don't forget that the physical and network security of your route CA is very important working with registration authorities is an optional addition to PKI and they're perfect for when in-person identification is needed before a certificate can be issued even if that means that a local Registration Authority needs to be set up to send requests to a distant CA key management is an important part of PKI we need to plan for the secure issuing revoking storing and recovering of keys and don't forget about M of n control that needs em out of a possible n recovery agents present to recover a key certificate management is also important and that's why all good public key infrastructures have certificate policies and certificate practice statements there are a number of trust models possible for implementing PK a hierarchical is a top-down or tree like structure a bridge ca links to separate trusts the mesh model creates a web or network of trust and really any or all different models can be combined to create a hybrid trust model so that's it for this lesson on PKI implementation thanks for watching
