good afternoon welcome back to the 6,200 class and in this short video we're going to provide some comment to the video public key based at Keith's stablishment and this is the segment and I thought four of them Bernays class so I have one major concern in this video if you look at the screen this is about the semantic security of the asymmetric encryption algorithm here first the Challenger will generate a public/private key pair and give the public key to the bad guy to the bad guy and based on the arrow the bad guy will generate two messages one is called m0 the other is called M 1 and M 1 and M 0 they have the exactly same lands so you cannot differentiate them based on how long they are even after the encryption result ok and then the Challenger will use the public key to encrypt one of the message to encrypt the one of the message and it generated the ciphertext and send it to the attacker and after the attacker is if the encryption result of m0 or m1 and if this approach itself is a semantic secure then the attacker a will not be able to differentiate it so attacker a will not get any knowledge or any incline that this is the encryption of m0 or m1 so if you look at here is that the probability that it is the method 0 minus the probability that if my sitting it's actually the encryption without of method one the difference between the two probability is some more than anything that you can imagine that basically means is smaller than it's it's get as close to zero as possible that basically means I give you an encrypted message and you have 50% chance gasps this is m1 and another 50% chance that is zero so we can flip a coin and guess it widely that is as good as you do all the analysis based on the encryption without okay so um so the definition of semantic security have no problem but the enforcement has some issue okay why is that this is actually a forward search attack example why let's look at this procedure so first the Challenger will give the public key tool to the attacker a what does I mean if I'm holding the public key that basically means I can incorrect whatever message that I want with this public key okay and then let's see second the attacker we have generated two message and there an m1 okay so I got the bad guy get the public key the bad guy generated these two messages and then nothing will be able to prevent this attacker to encrypt those messages with the public key well that's I mean so I'm the bad guy I have the public key and I have the message m0 I'm going to apply the public key to the message m0 and in credit I will get the encryption result for the same for the same procedure I will be able to encrypt the message m1 so now I have the corresponding ciphertext and a plaintext okay and then the Challenger will randomly pick one message and encrypt with the public key and a thinny back this is ciphertext and you ask oh is it the encryption of m0 or m1 okay from the bad guys point of view I don't have to gas the private key and open it up why I don't have to use the secret token big app because I have already encrypt m0 and m1 respectively with the public key so no matter here you choose m0 or m1 your ciphertext C will be one of the encryption result so I don't have to open it I just to compare the ciphertext and I will be able to figure it out so I'm not sure Tampere make some mistakes or make some mistakes or he assumes that we will not do those kind of for search attack or pre-computation from the bad guy so so you understand so umm it a different way of presenting this game is that the Challenger will generated a public/private key pair and the Challenger will generate two messages not the attacker but the Challenger will generate the two messages m0 and m1 and then the Challenger will encrypt m0 and will randomly pick one message and encrypted with public key and give it to the attacker and then we cannot really give the message to the attacker because if we do the attacker will be able to encrypt the with public key we can give him some commitment like a hash without m0 and hash without of m1 so in this way we're not going to change the messages and then we ask the attacker ok we generate the two message and here is the hash of method 1 here is the hash of method 2 and here the encryption result of one of the message and our question is could you guess the encryption without we give you is it the encryption of method one or message two and since we give you the hash result of both of message which means we are not going to change them we're not gonna change them after you are wild gas or analysis whichever you're going to use and we're going to review both of the message so that you can verify we're going to tell you what is public private key and we're going to tell you what is M 0 and what is M 1 so you can have some to make sure we don't lie and you can increment ooh make sure we really give you the ciphertext and then we will figure out or you will find out that the chance that you've got gas correctly is only 50% which is exactly like you're tossing the coin so your analysis will not give you any advantage during this game ok so I think that will be a better way of presenting so um I don't think he make a mistake but I think he probably assumed that the bad guy will know how to do this forward search analysis ok okay so we have posted several videos related to TV Hellman an imino attack so we're not going to start a separate video for this for this segment so we will just say a few words okay if you look at this slide this slide actually illustrates the madman attack upon the TV Hellman protocol and just like we discussed at the very end of the previous week session ok why the men men attack is possible if you look at the slice you'll notice that here Alice will generate a random numbers more atcase a lowercase a ok and when Alice stand this same to Bob supposedly the generators identity Alice and the random numbers more case a are supposed to be bound together okay and why the man-made attack is possible because there is actually no bond so we're still using the identity of Alice but we replace the random numbers more case a with a new random number a prime so which basically means we break this bound and then we can change it this has a similar chance or it's a similar scenario for the main middle attack we gave it in the class of the exchange of the public keys or if you recall you go to the bar and hang out and your wingman is it's a very curious malicious guy which who will try to each drop on the communication between you and your girlfriend or boyfriend okay those examples are exactly the same there's no bond between the node identity and his or her public key or there's no bond between the identity and the cellphone number that actually lead to the possibility of this man tomato attack so that's all we needed to provide for the comment on this topic okay thank you and I was here in the class
