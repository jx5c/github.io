so welcome back in this way video we're going to discuss the interlock protocol to defend against a man-made attack okay so first let's look at the slides we said okay if two parties want to build a symmetric key to encrypt the data traffic between them we could use public key so there is a very straightforward simple approach here Alice will generate a session key so here Alice will generate a session key and encrypted with Bob's public key and of course then Bob can you decrypt a message with his private key and get the session key now both parties can know the secret and can talk secretly okay so of course we have discussed we have mentioned this in one of our earlier week video which is why would Bob trust Alice's capability to generated such a secure key but let's ignore that part temporarily in the see what's going on and why there is a man the middle attack getting involved so you can see the public key of the nodes do not have certificated with them then they can be fake keys and man-made attack can be conducted so we have gone through this in several other videos and so when what is a man-made attack and why is the meta meta attack possible so basically you have the note ID and the corresponding public key those two are supposed to be bound together and if there is no such bundle available then we are facing the problem so the bad guy could replace the public key and then we're going to be in trouble so there have been multiple videos and examples we posted so we will not go through the meta meta tag here but let's look at this so let's look at this so basically Alice said oh I need Bob's public key and then there is a public key server here we use Cassie but he could be Bob himself as well so it does not really matter from whom or from where the public key comes from so there's a bad guy seeking between Alice and Cassie and he's sitting here blocked the traffic look at the parent said oh he needs Bob's public key so he forward the message and then the Cassie will reply reply the public key of Bob which is EB and here the bad guy will be able to replace the public key of Bob with horror public key now it's become public key of Eve and Alice will not be able to differentiate the two public key so Alice will generate the secret key K s and increment with East public key so the F will be here intercept with the packet open the message with her private key C what is a secret and a repackage a that with the public key of Bob and send it to Bob so this is Amanda middle attack we have introduced this for several times so let's look at one example to see whether or not this will work okay so let's simplify this a little bit we don't have any key server Alice and we don't have any key server like Cassie but we only got Alice the bad guy malicious guy and the Bob so basically I want probabiy I wanted the public key of Bob I wanted the public key of Bob and that the bad guy will just afford this message of course Bob will say this is Papa Bob okay there should be some other components in this message like this is from Bob as if to Alice's as my public key and the bad guy will intercept it and the replace it was public key M and then subsequent steps we don't draw here so let's see we have seen many spy movies okay so Alice and Bob so let's say they are two spies and that we have seen this type officing scenarios in quite a few movies it's like this so Alice said hey Bob you go to that place and I worried that the enemy has set up a trap there so it's very possible that you will be captured okay so you'll be captured and after you are you're captured the bad guy will force you to call me okay don't resist the commie but if you are safe if you are safe when you pick up the phone and when you call me and when I answered your first a sentence should be I have pancake for breakfast that I know you're safe on the contrary if the bad guy force you to call me and you would say that yes I got the package which it's a very normal sentence which we send you there together the package so you will call me and said yes I got a package and if you have been captured by the enemy your first a sentence will be I had pancakes for breakfast so in this way I will know whether or not you're safe without causing any suspicious of the enemy so the enemy will not know that you have told me you are in danger and we will try to save you so what is this this is basically like Oh Alice and Bob have a great offline that okay this is the first message that you are going to send to me this will be the first a message you are going to send to me if the message is different then I know you are in danger so under this case let us see whether or not the man the middle attack is still possible okay so Palace said I want the probably key Bob said this is my public key and the bad guy the bad guy replaced the public key so let's see what if Alice based on the arrangement she will send the predetermine the message first so this is a message that they agreed on so the first time if where you are safe you should send me this message so Alice increment message with the public key of M and of course the bad guy will be able to open this message with the private key of M C the message and that the bad guy will not change anything by the send in the message to Bob directly but then measure the Bob directly Bob will open the message of which corresponding private keys see inside that so this is message this is our previous agreement if alice is safe then she should send me this message so alice is safe so basically we could see that if you have this a rendered message even if you have this tree or rendered a message and if you'll send this information without some appropriate operation why do we call it appropriate operation we're going to see it immediately okay this will not help us this will not help us so let's see and the LS and abhava figure out that okay so even if we have this prearranged a message even if we have this prearranged message if we are encrypting the message it will not defend against them in the middle attack in other words we will not be able to figure out whether or not there is somebody sitting in between and Alice said Bob I have a better idea and let us see whether or not this will work okay so we know that if you encrypt if you encrypt this message if you encrypt this message okay the bad guy will be able to open since the public key has been replaced he will use the corresponding private key to open it up how about instead of sending out any encryption I just send you the hash of the message okay so what is the beauty of a hash function the beauty of the hash function is that it is a signature of the message that you can actually not figure out what message it is okay so the bad guy will see this hash of the message the hash of the message and he will not be able to rebuild the message so what the bad guy can do okay so if you watch the video Q here my suggestion is you pause this video now think about it think about it so don't look at it the next minute immediately pause the video and think about it so if Alice said I won pops public key Bob sending the real public key the bad guy replace Bob the public key with the malicious public key and then Alice using the prearranged in message sent out a hash so in this way since this is a hash result method the malicious guy will not be able to figure out what is the message so my question is with this can you figure out there is someone sitting in between can you figure out there is someone sitting in between so pause the video think about it for two minutes once you are pretty sure your answer then you'll start to watch again okay so here I come back and I hope you have figured it out so what will be the bad guy do first the thing first that's the bad guy need to recover the message at all actually no the bad guy does not need to figure out the message what the bad guy will do is just forward whatever the message is if it the hash of the message I will just a forward it so Bob will see this Bob will see this and the Bob can verify that oh this is the original message in the hatchery down because I have the message I could hash it and of course then Alice will send out public key encryption message and then the bad guy will open it up and redecorate it become public here Bob to the message so in this case we could see well even if Alice and Bob have am Priya rented a message if they are sending the encrypted message either will not defend it will not be able to figure out there someone sitting in between and if they send the hash without the other party will not figure out there is something somebody is sitting in between so we still needed to twist it a little bit more okay so here it is how we're going to do it so let's look at another example and see whether or not it will work okay so now instead of sending out the hash readout of this message Alice will send out a separate a different message is a little bit front okay it will send out of the hash of encrypting it with the public key of M remember here Alice believe this public key is actually Bob's public key okay so what about if Alice encrypted the message first with the key which is supposed to be Bob's public key and then hash it and then send it to Bob and then let us see whether or not Bob will be able to figure out what to figure out whether or not there is somebody sitting in between and trying to replace the message trying to replace the message okay so let's take a look at this so if you are watching this video pause the video for two minutes think about it and see what the bad guy m can do to try to for Bob try to fool Bob at this moment so pause the video now okay so we're we're coming back and let's see I hope you have finally decided your answer it's a yes or no so let's before see what M can do and then let's look at what Bob is actually expecting okay Bob is expecting an encryption of the public key of Bob of the message so there's not enough time enough space for me to write the whole thing and then there's a hash okay Bob knows what message yes Bob knows what is his public key and abhava knows the hash function so Bob is expecting an exact message is expecting an exact exact the message so now let's see what the bad guy can do so the hash is a one day function so the bad guy cannot open the hash function and reboot the encryption of the message with the public key of M so whatever is inside the hash function is not available to the bad guy okay now let's see what the bad guy needed to construct the bad guy needed to construct the message include by the public key of Bob and then the hash function so the bad guy knows what is the hash function the bad guy knows what is the public key of Bob but unfortunately the bad guy does not know what is the message okay the bad guy will not be able to recover the message from the encryption of the message that hash so this is more like half of the encryption result it's very interesting okay so the bad guy now facing a big problem I need a tool have the message in credit and in the hazard but I could not gather the message from this Paquette I raise safe so I will not be able to construct this so what can the malicious guy do the malicious guy can forward this and said s but remember the Bob knows what the message is Bob know what his public key is and what the hash function is so Bob is expecting an exacta message coming in so if am just a forward this packet a to baba baba will immediately notice that oh this is not right this is not right okay so Bob and the malicious guy am cannot just forward the packet well there's another approach so it's just a hash readout right it's what 256 bits the malicious guy can just randomly generate 256 bits and just a forward - Bob said here go well the problem is Bob is expecting an exact a message okay exactly how this 21 56 bits should look like and if you'll put your coin 256 times and the god forbid it's the same as this message Bob is expecting your coin must really have magic okay so the chance that your red tomatoes generate 2050s experience is exactly the same as here is almost at zero it's almost zero okay so basically the bad guy cannot afford this because this is not what Bob is packing you cannot generate one randomly twenty-fifth weeks to foo Bob because Bob knows what he's expecting so in under this case Bob will notice that there is something happening in between and the trial blocking their traffic okay and when we come back here we will have to step back one second and look at the previous example again okay if you recall in the previous example we're saying oh you stead of sending out of the increment message with the fake public key why don't we just ascend out of the hash of the message hash of the message okay and and about five minutes ago we say this is not good this is not good you will say that well look at the hash message okay to calculate the hash message you needed a hash function which the bad guy knows and you need also needed the message of the hash it but the bad guy am here if he received the hash of the message the bad guy am keen on the reveal of the message because the one day property of the function so how can bad guy generated the fake message okay the difference is that this is the hash message okay it has nothing to do it has nothing to do with the fake public key it has nothing to do with the fake public key okay so under this case whether or not you'll be save a fake public key will not impact the hash result of the message so that's why the bad guy could just forward the hash of the message and the Bob will not be able to figure out there's somebody in between and the look head of the message and forwarded it okay on the contrary if you look at this in this piece of information we provided here is what it is the message first encrypted by the public key and then hash so this part is totally determined by the message the public key enter the hash function okay so now if you receive a fake public key the result will be different and at the same time since we have this hash result this hash function to prevent the bad guy from recovering the inside information the bad guy will get a stuck here and cannot transmit the information out okay so this is an interlock protocol in the interlock protocol you'll actually send out half of the message half of the message and to the other party and try to detect whether or not there is a bad guy sitting in between sitting in between okay so this is the interlock protocol if you believe that if you believe that you understand this example why the interlock protocol can be used to detect the man-made attack let us look at in the next question this is an open question and we ask you to go back and think about it and look at it and these cards with your classmates if you have to in the discuss in this discussion forum is also okay so this is an open question okay so we just just now we present an interlock protocol which your hash and inside is encryption of the public key of the message what about we switch the order of the encryption and hash so here Alice will first hash the message and outside will use the public key which she believed is Bob's public key although the public key is actually belonging to M and then for outside use the public key of M to encrypt the hash read out and try to send to Bob and the goal here is for Bob to figure out whether or not there is somebody sitting in between whether or not there is somebody sitting in between and the look head of their traffic look at their traffic so Bob knows exactly what he is expecting okay it's actually the hash of the message outside included by the public here Bob okay so the question is whether or not you think Bob will be able to detect there somebody in between in other words what should the bad guy am do to prevent Bob from discovering that he is seeking in between Alice and Bob and look at every packet traffic between them so this is an open question go home and think about it so why do we have such an open question so at the very beginning of this semester we have mentioned that there are a limited number of building blocks to build security protocols you have hash function you have symmetric encryption asymmetric encryption you have digital signature all that stuff okay at that time we did a week we present very clearly that even with this limited a number of blocks you can build a thousands of different protocols okay but we're not saying that all those thousands of protocols you're building with this box they are secure so it's very possible that you have put all the security mechanism you known into this protocol but if you design and put together in the wrong way the protocol will not be secure so this is a very good example we give you quite a few different cases we say Oh what about Alice and Bob pre a random message when they first to communicate with each other they have to send out that message will that work if they send out the message in clear text obviously it's not working what about in credit with the public key so if the bad guy already replaced the public key it will open it up in a C is not good what about we hash it is not good the bad guy will just forward it what about if we first encrypt that then has we figure out that of that will work that's a good design of this interlock protocol and then we are having in this open question is what about we hash first and then encrypt do you think this is a safe way for Alice and Bob to detect whether or not there's somebody sitting in between okay this is open question think about it these cards are classmates and you could these concepts in the discussion forum and I will be more than happy to see the discussion and answers okay so I will see you in the next video
