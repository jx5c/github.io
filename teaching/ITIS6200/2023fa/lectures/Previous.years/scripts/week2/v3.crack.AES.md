good morning everyone and welcome back to I guess 6280 200 in the previous two videos we play the introduction to symmetric encryption algorithms and we provide a comment and during this commenting video and also in the introduction to cementery encryption when important property of the algorithm is the key lens you can see that in the past a few years especially after the DES encryption algorithm has been compromised it seems that the key lens becomes longer and longer so statistically saying the longer the key is the safer is the algorithm if the encryption algorithm is appropriately designed okay because if the bad guys have to use the brute-force attack which means to try every possible key then after a certain threshold the number of possible keys will become so big that the bad guys will not be able to try a certain percentage of the keys before the universe collapse back to that single point however we know that the bad guys will not focus on a single attack if this approach does not work they're going to try another work so here we want to share with you some of the news report if not it's not confirmed from my side but I believe the approach described in the paper is quite possible so if you look at the screen it shows up is called aes-256 encryption key is correct by hands of a hack okay so there will be some exercise in our course and you will see that a twenty five six bit ski lens is more than enough for most of the security mechanism it's almost impossible for you to use brute force attack to crack the key so what do the guys use the guides used something called side channel attack so here I highlighted on the screen it's a side channel attack there are different types of side channel attacks I will give you some example and the first let's introduce this this side channel attack what they are doing is they are measuring the electromagnetic signals emitted by the CPU or by the device well is conducting the encryption operations okay so here we are using a rush here we are using a join software okay so let's say this is a CPU of course you have different input okay you have the input to the CPU so that it can encrypt and during this procedure you have the data to come in and you have the key coming in and of course you need the encryption algorithm we all know that the encryption algorithm the modern encryption algorithm should be public so the only thing that it's really a secret is the key okay so if the algorithm is public that basically means the bad guy will be able to conduct its own encryption implementation it can implement okay you can have the source code and then of course because of the input of the key and an input of the data the CPU will use different amount of energy okay it will give different amounts of energy and this energy can be mentally in different ways one simple way is at the input of CPU at the power permission side you can put on a measurement device to see how much energy is actually used and of course it will be extremely hard for the bad guys to put something at the CPU on the CPU foot on the foot to actually measure the used energy but another way while your CPU is calculating the encryption algorithm it will emit or it will send out the electromagnetic signals because of the operation on the CPU and of course the signal will change because the key is different the data is different and also depends on which algorithm component it is using so the pair guides will actually be able to set up an antenna and to measure the signals the electromagnetic signals coming from your CPU and based on the properties of the signal and they will try to figure out what is the value of the key byte okay the reason is called a side channel attack it's not trying to figure out what is the key they're not doing ruthless attack they're not analyzed the plaintext and ciphertext and try to figure out the property of the keys on the contrary they are using some other properties they can use the energy consumption they can use the electromagnetic signals actually there are efforts to measure the heat generation actually basically that basically means how much energy you're using but they can remotely measure the temperature over the chip and see which part use more power and they try to use the heat patterns to figure out which application you are actually running okay so this is just a short video to show now the attackers are very creative so don't think that oh if I choose a 28:56 pH key or if I choose a two 2096 bits key of asymmetric encryption or rhythm it's secure enough it's secure enough against the brute-force attack but there are other attacks the bad guys are trying actually in the past a few years that side channel attacks become more and more popular at both the CPU side and the system side and we're going to cover more in the later section of the course so I just want to provide this part of information to you so if you're interested you can google this document and see what actually happens and how the attackers are doing it and with that thank you so much for watching and I will see you for the next topic thanks
