in this video we're going to present a little bit more about the symmetric and asymmetric encryption algorithms we are not going to discuss hash function we're going to save hash function for the next week because hash function deserves a whole lot of discussion ok so we have introduced a symmetric encryption algorithm at different places from the it's the abstract concept we have so far we have not discussed any sub Civic algorithm ok we're going to discuss one or two examples later ok so the major problem faced by cementery encryption algorithm if you look at the slides is that how can we determine the key actually this is also quite a few of you mentioned this in the discussion forum so we're going to discuss that later when we discuss where we introduced this key tablish mint protocols ok and also a number of keys increase very fast enough scalable so we have known that and that's why in the 70s we started to investigate asymmetric encryption algorithm the first one in asymmetric encryption algorithm actually proposed by DV and helmet it's very interesting there's a long story we are going to introduce later involved IBM and the NSA and two keys you have public and private keys it's impossible to derive a private key from public keys so now Alice and Bob agree on a public key encryption algorithm baths and his public key to Alice and Alice will use Bob's public key in from the med students than it back and the Bob can decrypt and message with the private key oh very straightforward it is solved the problem in symmetric encryption algorithm which you can deliver the key in public ok so what do we mean in symmetric encryption algorithm in symmetric encryption algorithm we have a and B and they share a pairwise symmetric encryption key which is kab so the sub-index a and B may present that both a and B have a copy ok so now Alice will send a message encrypted by the kab to Bob and bubble will be able to decrypt it the problem we're facing is how can we deliver the key Alice cannot just ascends the key two balls it Oh Bob this is kab because we have said if we have an eavesdropper that guy here he or she will be able to get a copy of the key you don't want to do that it's just alike you're not supposed to send your password and email if we are dealing with asymmetric encryption algorithm we actually avoid this problem no sorry we actually avoid this problem so we still have a and B now we have public key of a private key of a and of course Alice will send a copy which is the public key of A two A two Bob said hey Bob this is Alice this is my public key and then Bob will be able to send back a message encrypted it by the public key of Alice and this is message be message from the Bob and it's encrypted by the public key of a and allots will be able to decrypt with the private key of Alice and see what's inside okay now the most important thing is we can deliver the public key through the communication channel directly okay in real life it's a little bit more complicated than that you cannot just stand out the public key has clear text because the bad guy will change it we're going to discuss the part later but basically is much better than some entering encryption at least you can deliver it if you don't so you don't worry about the message will be will be open to the bad guy okay and we have new problems how can we make sure that this is Bob's public key or Alice's public key instead of other people's and we're going to discuss that later especially we're going to introduce this certificate problem okay this is actually faced by every one of us by your by your browser and some story about public key the first the public key encryption algorithm was proposed by deviant Hellman in the late 70s at that time an essay is trying to pushing their DES encryption algorithm so as I said oh no no we don't need an asymmetric encryption algorithm cementery is good enough however at the same time and say on one side said oh we don't need that it's totally unnecessary but at the same time and as you claim credit for that basically anything said ah we know the distance of asymmetric encryption algorithm ten years ago yeah we know we know that way before you guys yes so but still we believe is unnecessary so it's it's very interesting um from the national security point of view I can totally understand an essay or any other agency not only United fate but any other country so basically we want something that the bad guys could not I'll read but the good guys could so the bad guys could not compromise our secret but we could figure out their terrorists to plan ok this is in the dream world how things supposed to work ok and so now we have two sets of problem to have two sets of algorithm symmetric masters are fast either the implement that requires special attention during key distribution the asymmetric encryption algorithm is slow and more more secure but it take care of partially take care of this key distribution problem so what we're doing in real life we are using asymmetric encryption to distribute keys and use cementery encryption to encrypt the data why because asymmetric encryption is slope right so we use it to encrypt a very small amount of traffic which is the symmetric encryption key and then we use the key to encrypt a whole lot of traffic roughly in something like this Bob will send Alice his public key and then Alice will encrypt the session key which is a symmetric key with its public key in Santa Bob both Bob and Alice know the cementery session key and they can use it for data traffic ok so let's take a quick look and then we can discuss what is the potential problem I keep forgetting others we have Alice and Bob and Bob of course have probably keep a ball in private cue ball so the first thing is Oh Bob will send Alice said hey this is Bob this is my public key ok the ls will generate a cement Ricky kab and then send it back said Oh Bob this is Alice and this is our session key encrypted by your public key when Padre say this message since this message encrypted by the public key Bob will be able to use the private key to open it up to see kab now both sides fkb they can communicate with each other encrypt the traffic which kb and here the kab it's a symmetric key used to the cementery encryption algorithm they can talk back and forth to each other so what's the good thing the good thing is you can see key is relatively short key is 128 a bit 256-bit and so on so forth it's a very small scale traffic so you're using asymmetric encryption algorithm to encrypt it even though it's one salt in the time is slower when your encrypt of a small block it's relatively fast it take let's say 3.5 seconds but still you only need two point five seconds once you deliver this cementery kab you can start to encrypt a huge amount of traffic and it since this symmetric encryption algorithm is 1,000 times faster than a symmetric encryption of data then you can encrypt a large amount of traffic and this is actually happen every day happening every day in our real life for example when you log into your unity computer and when you try to accept the traffic excessive files stored on the 8th drive or H Drive it's actually a buffer it's actually stored in the server in the basement of the library and the traffic will assess the file the traffic is actually encrypted it's actually encrypted by the symmetric encryption key well when you actually accept the file and how the key is it tablet between your machine and the server cultural and asymmetric encryption algorithm it's actually a variation of the DV helmet algorithm which we're going to introduce later okay one problem one problem why should Barbra trust Alice's capability to generate keys so let's look at this procedure so Bob give Alice his public key and Alice will generate the kab and we know that a good symmetric encryption I'll go good symmetric encryption key should be random and should be unpredictable ok so now baba is basically saying oh um yeah now I need a key and Alice will generate a key and the Bob will say um I'm not sure whether or not you have the capability to generate a secure key that is random enough i think i would drop the mic and ability to generate the key better Alice will say no no I don't think you're good either ok so now we're facing a problem and this is actually a take-home question for this week and you can discuss this in our discussion forum ok so basically we're facing a problem like this we have two parties a and B they want to jointly generate a key they want to jointly generate a key so let's say Alice and Bob they are standing face to face they are standing face to face instead okay let's determine key so that when I coach when I go back to home we can talk to each other secure ok so Alice and Bob then face to face and they need to jointly determine key and Alice said ok I will generate a 180 key and 128-bit key and we can use it that and Bob will say no no no no I don't think you have the good capability to generate secure key why don't i generate the key and we use it and Alex said no no no no I don't trust you either so now we need to design mag needham to satisfy the following requirement first the two parties will jointly determine the key second neither side neither side can determine any bit of the key by himself or herself in other words okay every bit of the final key is actually jointly determined by the two parties so we want the key to be jointly determined okay neither party can determine any bits of the key by himself or herself what do we mean this okay I'll give you an example you understand what I mean so let's say Alice and Bob of 12 20 Lee determine 128-bit key and if you propel the mechanism said Alice you generated 64 bits Bob you generate 64 bits and we concatenate them so this is from Alice's 64 this is Bob 64 you put them end to end you will have a 128-bit key this is not Alice and Bob jointly determine the key and the neither of the side can solely determine the bit by himself or herself because now Ellis will have total control of the first half and the Bob will have the total control of the second half we want to make sure that every bit every bit of the final key is jointly determined by the two parties so go back home and this is the think about the question in this week's course and you can discuss this in the discussion forum ok so I think we will stop here and we will see you next week and we're going to discuss hash function in the next week and then we probably will discuss the public key certificate sure enjoy the rest of the weekend and I will see you next Tuesday
