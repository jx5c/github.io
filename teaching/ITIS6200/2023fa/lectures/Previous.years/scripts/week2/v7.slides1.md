good morning and welcome back to the 62 180 200 a class in the next video we're going to introduce the second part of the slides as we posted online please understand that we're not going to introduce the slides page by page you're supposed to read the slides and we're only going to present some detailed explanation of the concepts or the parts that we believe may cause some confusion so please understand you need to read the slides and watch the video okay thanks so let's see in this the next set of slides we basically introduced the operations the frequently used operations in cryptography like encryption and sometime we discuss hash function as well so there are two things we won't emphasize in this page if you look at it so we are saying that if you look at great so let's see um here we said that the cipher tags surely has the same lens as the plane tags or even longer actually in our previous video will be explained this and we also have this in the homework because of this one-to-one mapping between the cipher text and clear text it's very hard for the ciphertext to be shorter than play tag if you're not conducting compression to the information okay and the second thing which is very interesting is can you apply the encryption or decryption algorithm to some random sequence in other words if I have a block of plain text which is meaningful like a real English sentence we can definitely in credit it if I generated some random garbage a bunch of characters without any meaning coolio encrypted it yes you can so the encryption is more like an algorithm or it's like a procedure so as long as it meets the requirement for example unds it can only encrypt a eight byte block each time okay longer than eight byte we need to cut it into multiple blocks so the DES encryption algorithm does not really care is that a meaningful sentence like I love you which is eight characters if you don't count the space or is something sounds like Chewbacca is mowing it does not really matter to the dsl got rhythm it will just encrypt the message and if you apply the correct decryption message it will recover or regional content whether or not the content is meaningful it's a separate issue okay so why do we want to emphasize this whether or not you can apply encryption decryption algorithm to some random sequence because in the later especially when we are dealing with key distribution procedure this may cause some trouble and lead to malicious attack okay so we leave a one part here for later description okay and what functionality came kravchenko rhythm provide confidentiality technically authentication is basically to show who you are and digital signature or asymmetric encryption can be used to achieve this goal integrity means whether or not you have the content has been changed in the net repudiation which will prevent you from denying that you actually sign the document or you're actually send the document all this can be achieved through crypto mechanisms there are two types of mechanisms encryption mechanisms available one is to keep the secret keep the mancers encryption algorithm secret the other is make the algorithm public but keep the key secure or secret as a secret so actually in temper nice video he had mentioned this okay you have to use the second type of the mechanism it's the first type magneto secure the major reason is that only the second and type of encryption algorithm will be able to conduct analysis on the security of the methods and and we can review it and we can figure out whether or not there's some vulnerability and at the same time even if you keep the matter the secret okay people will eventually figure out how its encryption conducted for example we can put your encryption algorithm you know virtual machine and look at all the CPU operations and we will figure out what you're doing or we can do reverse engineering you're going to provide the executable code anyway and we can reverse engineering making it to assembly code and convert it to a high level programming language like C or other type and eventually we're going to figure out what you're doing so keeping the algorithm as a secret will not really provide your actual safety so please make sure you understand this ah so a symmetric encryption algorithm in asymmetric encryption algorithm so for the symmetric encryption algorithm it's basically the cement encryption decryption or using the same key or you can easily derive out one key from the other okay this is different from a symmetric encryption rhythm because in asymmetric encryption algorithm you have the public key and private key we make the public key public you cannot derive out the private key from the public key so we prevent this thing from happening okay and of course there are blocking algorithm and the stream algorithm which 10 per day has already emphasized several things okay the symmetric encryption algorithm theoretically we are still thinking it's about 1,000 times faster when you're compared to a symmetric encryption algorithm with the same level she so that's why we say cementery encryption algorithm is very very fast the major problem involves several things were the keep redistribution the scalability the broadcast of mouth cast and the proof of certain party so let's shortly describe ok so one of the major problem in symmetric encryption algorithm is how can you distribute key to the other side so let's see yeah I'm sorry so let's say you have two parties you have a and B and of course they want encrypt they needed to have a secret called kab which basically means it's a secret key shared between a be ok the problem is how can we make sure both sides have this secret key so you cannot just as send out a message said hey Bob this is Alice this is the kab we're going to use you cannot do this because the bad guy will eat job on the communication channel and actually get a copy of the key so you have to go through some external channel which is secure so how do we do that we're going to introduce the key to tribution algorithm later but this is definitely a very challenging problem for this for this symmetric encryption algorithm ok the second problem is interesting ok the second problem we're interested we are facing it's the number of keys or the scalability easy for example so let's say just now we say oh if we have a and B we need a kab what about if we now we have C C needed to communicate with both a and B and maybe she want to talk to a without letting be know anything about it so what does she need C will need KAC and KBC and now I need a new key which is ka c and b need a new key which is KBC ok so far so good everybody only need the two keys what about now we have D of course he needed to talk to a B and C now everybody need a three keys this guy needed to know talk to d as well talk to d as well talk to d as well so now you see if we have em people if we have 10 people everybody will need n minus one key because you need a different key for every one of the other people and of course you could say that oh um you know but there is overlapping definitely you're right there is overlapping which basically means a and the B will share one key so all together how many keys are going to have you have fun people everybody got the minus one key and every key is shared by two person only so you have n times a month 1/2 okay so if n is really large we're talking about roughly half of 10 square and you have all learned algebra so you know when you have an N Squire the curve with like this this is N and this is n square the curve is reaching like this which means the number of cheats or number of keys will reach very fast will increase very fast ok the second problem will do this cementery encryption algorithm if you have purely pairwise the key which basically means every two notes have every two nodes have a different key that the other problem is how do you how do you make how do you make a broadcast or multicast for example if a wants to send to both P and see what can he do okay she need to encrypt with kab was the message and then encrypt with Kaz of the message so now what we are facing if you want to send it to K people if you want to send it to X people you need to you create X copy of the same message with different key which is not a very scalable approach okay so that's why we said you have keep redistribution problem you're facing scalability problem broadcast or multicast approve of third party so there are many problems faced by cementery encryption
