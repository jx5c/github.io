good morning and welcome back to 60 to 100 80 to 100 and in this video we're gonna provide some commenting for the cementery encryption algorithm and a symmetric encryption mechanisms that you just watch okay before we go to any details of the algorithm you can see on the screen we are showing the exclusive or operation I do want to emphasize the same as a computer science major we have to understand what is exclusive or operation and you should be able to calculate the result without any calculator or special device if I give you a pen and a pencil I'll give you two numbers that are not very long these white numbers you should be able to calculate the exclusive-or result okay this is a must so I want to emphasize and in today's class we're going to use some special - which is like a drawing board so I will be able to draw or write on the screen while we recorder the screen okay so in addition to hand calculate the exclusive or operation a there are several properties about the exclusive or operation we won't emphasized the first thing is we have if we have a bit wide number a if we have a number a with a lot of bits and if we are calculating the exclusive-or of a with itself what should we get okay remember for exclusive or operation if the two bits are the same we will get zero if the two bits are different we will get one so for a and a every bit is aligned so you always have the same value so the final result will be zero zero a whole bunch of zero every bit will be zero so it's actually zero okay the second property we want make sure you understand is that a exclusive or with B so basically one number a exclusive or with another number B will equal to B exclusive or with a in other words the order of the operators does not matter okay you can switch them it's totally okay okay so if a exclusive or with a equals to zero what about a exclusive or with zero you know many many bits of zero that have the same lands as a number a and since everything exclusive or with zero will get itself so you're cause you're still can't get a so every bit will preserve the same value okay then what about a exclusive or with a number containing all the bits that are one so this value has the same bit Landsat as a for example if a contain 128 bits this value contain 128 bits as well but everything is 1 so what will be the result so in exclusive or operation if you are doing an XOR operation with a bit 1 you have to flip the bit value so in this way a inclusive or with all the bits of 1 that basically means you flip every bits of the value of a and there are different ways of writing it and frequently you're going to see something like this which basically means you're flipping every bits of a ok so this you shoe the result you should have learned this in your in your first or second year math class and we just want to refresh your memory a little bit ok here we are at about minute one minute 47 stand for seven seconds of the video and here he is talking about the stream cipher okay so the stream cipher is basically we don't pre-cut the clear text into a fixed size blocks but we treated them as a continuous flow of beats and of course there are two scenarios we needed to consider okay I'm sorry that I some time I need to lean forward to switch the process wait I might need to switch to this so that we can start to write on that or two on it okay okay so let's see so if we have a stream cipher which patient means we have a flow of bits that we need to incorrect and of course there are two scenario we need to consider the first scenario is said we have the clear text when we say clear text sometime we say plain text which basically means to English or without whatever language you want to encrypt so clear text is shorter then the key then that's great why because if we are using the exclusive or operation because the clear tax is shorter than the key that basically means we have not finished using all the bit of the key we already finished the encryption operation so no problem okay the second the problem is what about the clear text sorry is longer than the key now we have a problem for example the clear text is 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 so 8 bits and the key is only 4 bits 1 0 1 0 ok now we have a problem we have 8 bits clear text and the 4 bits key so how can we encrypt 8 bits with a 4 bit key well we could reuse it what does I mean we do 4 bits of exclusive operation after that we use the same four bit key again okay if we started to reuse the key we are facing some security problem we won't ever sent here why if we start to reuse that basically means there are two bits there are two bits in the clear text they are encrypted by this same bits of key so basically if we will start to reuse the key that basically means multiple bits of plaintext encrypted with the same key bit that basically means multiple bits of plaintext are actually encrypted ated with the same key bits then because they are encrypted by the same key bits their final value will expose some relationship for example there are two bits this one and this one they are both included by this bit value what and because one exclusive-or was one we'll get at zero so the final ciphertext this bit will be zero this bits will be zero as well so let's say if I am the bad guy if I'm the bad guy if I know this two bits are actually include by the same key bits and if they are the same just in the ciphertext what could I learn I will learn that this two bits this one and this one they have the same value in the clear text will I know are they both 0 or both 1 I cannot know why because I don't know the corresponding key bits I don't know the value of this one but I know these 2 bits will be increased by the same bit in the key so if their results are the same their original clear tags are the same as well so in this way although the bad guy does not know the specific value of the clear text or the key it learns some information about it this actually will lead to the information leakage and this actually we try to avoid that ok and this actually leads to if we go back to the slides you can see there is something cause sorry so there's a one-time pad so what is a one-time pad a one-time pad is actually the scenario that the key is actually longer than or have the same lands at the clear-text at the same time the keys dream is actually generated randomly and it's never you know repeating itself or it's not reused okay so in this way if it's a one-time pad you can prove that it's uncompromised ball so what do I mean by uncompromised ball let's say tomorrow the aliens from the Mars landed on the earth and they have some super duper computer which is I don't know gazillion times faster than the fastest computer on the earth and they have super knowledge in maths than us still they will not compromise this one-time pad okay maybe they will compromise RSA if they have a computer that is Couvillion times faster than us but they will not be able to compromise one-time pad and now we are at about 11 minutes 54 seconds in the video there are actually two things I want to emphasize in this this slides the first thing if you look at at the top it actually the plaintext to ciphertext mapping must be one-to-one for a given key this is a very very important and let us show one thing and we can explain this explain this one to one mapping this is a one-to-one mapping what do I mean okay so let's say we have a 64 bits clear text and we have 128-bit key and of course you throw this 64 bit clear text and this 128-bit key into an encryption algorithm it will give you the ciphertext I don't know whether or not you have noticed that that for most well for well for almost all encryption algorithms cementery encryption algorithm especially the block the block cipher the clear text the size of the clear text it's usually larger than or equal to the clear text well that's I mean if we have 64 bits block clear text and cipher text will have at least at 64 bits maybe it's longer but it will never be shorter it'll never be smaller you will not have 64 bits clear text after encryption you will always get a 62 bits ciphertext block why is that okay this is because it's one-to-one mapping first we have a clear text that is 64 bits long so what does that mean that means we have 64 bits altogether 64 bits altogether and for every bit we have two possible levels it's either 0 or 1 so in this way you for this bit we have 0 or 1 for the second bid we have 0 or 1 so how many different values can we have for a clear text of block for every bit we have 2 possible value we can have 2 to the power of 64 possible clear text blocks okay so now we choose one key that is 128 bits and we encrypt every one of this clear text block okay because this one-to-one mapping that basically means every clear tag the block if it is different from the remaining of the clear text block the ciphertext the block block should also be different so if you have two different clear text block after encryption they should have different ciphertext block okay so we have two to the power of 64 possible clear text and that basically means we will have two to the power of 64 possible ciphertext block okay to represent this two to the power of 64 possible values of ciphertext blocks how many bits do you need you will need at lift 64 bits that explain why for the ciphertext block it will never be shorter than the clear text block if you do not apply some compression or you know zip algorithm to the encryption algorithm okay so now let's draw a figure so that we can have a better understanding of this one-to-one mapping okay so let's say this is the possible space of clear text or or plain text PT okay every dot is a possible clear text block every dot is a possible clear text block and here is the space for ciphertext block CT and every dot here is a possible ciphertext block this one-to-one mapping means oh this one will be after encryption will become this one this one will become this one this one will become this one so on so forth and you can see because if it's a one-to-one mapping this side cannot be smaller than this side because it's a one-to-one mapping okay so you cannot have a smaller space on this side that is why the ciphertext is always have the same lands or even longer than the clear-text well you would ask okay is it possible that we have this clear text a space like this but the ciphertext space like this which basically means much lighter what will be the case if it's much louder well you will still have a one-to-one mapping however because this space is larger than this clear-text test space that basically means well there is no mapping to this specific triangle point so there is a ciphertext you cannot to throw it into the decryption algorithm or it will not give you a valid result okay so what does that mean there are actually two possible explanations for this one the first explanation is okay remember this mapping with when we say it's a one-to-one there is also a key we have to chip in here okay so basically when we say oh there's no clear text after encryption will be mapped to this triangle we are saying oh under key 1 under the first key there is no mapping between any clear text to this triangle value in the ciphertext and your key - there's no mapping between any clear text to this corresponding ciphertext however under key 3 there might be so which basically means for this specific ciphertext it will only work for certain keys so with certain keys you can throw it into a decryption algorithm it will give you a result for other keys it will not this is the first possible scenario the second possible scenario is that okay for any keys or in other words for all keys you will never see a clear text after encryption to this triangle so you may ask okay what's going on okay it is possible let's say we're just going to give an example it is possible that for this sub cific encryption algorithm the ciphertext in the ciphertext the beat 3 and the bit for will always be the same so for this specific encryption algorithm no matter how you change the clear text and how you change the key the ciphertext you will always have P 3 and P 4 exactly the same that basically means if you have a value in the cipher text space that B 3 and a bit for they are different then it is not a violent valid a ciphertext it will not be a valid ciphertext in other words you cannot throw this triangle guy into the decryption rhythm to give you a corresponding clear text no matter what key you are choosing so what does that mean that basically means we have redundancy we actually have redundancy in the ciphertext because P 3 and P 4 they're always the same so you only needed to recover one bit okay you don't need to recorder both and you can reduce the space okay so these are the two possible scenario in which when we have this ciphertext space is actually longer or louder than the clear text space so what actually happens okay the next thing we won't emphasize is about the input and output a should have no correlation in other words if you change one bit of the input block about 50% of the encryption result should change why do I want this okay let's consider this scenario so let's say you stay in the hotel we know that all the hotel will have those four-digit lock safe now okay so let's say you change or you set up your password to the safe to be 1 2 3 4 and when you go out to do some shopping a malicious guy a sieve sneaks into your hotel room and try to open your safe and a steal your iPad ok however the bad guy does not know the key so what can he do he will try every possible key ok so let's see so you have a safe and you said the key as one two three four okay and the bad guy deceive sneak into your room and tried to open your safe so what will he do he will try all the possible key try all the key so without any you know without losing generality we say that guys select one one one one what will the safe do will the save generate some response to the bad guy it will not it will just show to see if that okay it cannot open will the saved hell deceive said oh you know what see if the first digit your input is correct but the second certain force bits are wrong maybe you want try again you do not want this type of feedback it is the same thing here it is it same thing here what does I mean so let's say I have the ciphertext and I want to take a while the gas of what is your clear text okay so I try some encryption and we want to make sure that okay the bad guy will not be able to learn anything from this trying and failed procedure that basically means it will not learn anything by looking at the result said oh the ciphertext and now is only five bits different from the block I try to cropped that basically means if there are five bit different between the ciphertext block there are three bits difference of the clear text so I'm almost the right no we do not want to provide any type of this feedback to the bad the bad guy will only learn one thing from this try and fail procedure it's either he cracking it or he does not if he does not crack it it he will not derive out any knowledge from this procedure basically he cannot derive out which bit is correct or which bit is wrong he just needed to try another value only in this way we want to maximize the workload of the bad guy to compromise the that recovered the cipher the clear text or to you know get out what is the key okay so I hope this resolved some of the concern for you for symmetric encryption we will have another video for asymmetric encryption okay thank you
