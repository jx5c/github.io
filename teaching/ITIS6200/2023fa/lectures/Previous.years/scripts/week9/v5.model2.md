so welcome back and in the previous video we introduced a bell a popular module but a model we introduced this simple security condition okay but if you pay attention you will notice that in this simple security condition we only define whether or not you can read a file and of course we know that whenever we talk about what you can do over a file we need to consider both read and write so that's why we need a second property which is called a star property to manage the writing procedure to whether or not you are allowed to write to a file okay there is always some confusion caused by this part so we're gonna slow down and give several examples so that you understand okay start property a person s can write to a file if and only if the classification of the file is not lower than the clearance of the person and the person has discretionary writing access to the file okay we always receive some feedback and this always cause some confusion actually when I first alert this model when I see this property I'm pretty confused why let's look at this okay we have a person s and we have a file oh okay we said s can write to all if and only if the classification of o is not lower than a clearance of s in other words the file needed to be at least as the same level of the person or the file could be at a higher level than the person Wow that basically means oh you cannot write it down but you can write up you can write to the file with the same level or you can write it to a higher level okay and this always costs something and so before we introduced so before we resolve your confusion but first look at an example and see why do we need such a rule to control the writing operations okay so we have example illustrated on the my board we still have those four level of clearance level in a top secret a secret classified in the public okay and here we have two person one if the general and the other is a soldier the general has the top secret clearance level the soldier only has the classified secret level and on the other side we have two files one is plan to attack Mars which is a top secret file in in all the days when I teach this course I sometimes put some countries here okay but now we are video recording it and whichever country I put here will offend some people so let's put marks here okay so hopefully we will never have to you made Mars okay so just just for kidding okay so so we have a plan to attack Mars of course it's a top secret level okay and of course in the military we have this lunch manual it's classified so you may ask why the lunch man is classified instead of public I don't know maybe because the food the quality is so bad and we don't want the general public to know how bad of the food is so I don't know so let's say this is just a classified okay based on the Pella popular model the general will be able to read this file so let's here assume that the general and the soldier all have the discretionary permission okay the general can read the plan to attack Mars the solar can read the lunch manual so that he will know well should I eat at the dining hall or should I out of pocket and go outside eat McDonald okay and of course the general will be able to read the file why because this is why because the file actually has a lower clearance level okay so now let's say if we are if we allow if we allow the write down part if we allow the write down part if we allow the general to write to this lunch menu what type of problem so let's say the general will open two files simultaneously the general will open two files simultaneously so let's this side is the top-secret attack planned on this side it's the classified lunch manual ok so let's say by accident or intentionally the general highlighted it a portion from the top secret of file and then he pushed the button ctrl C and we all know that this will copy this segment of text and then either by accident or intentionally so let's say the general push ctrl V and the right into this lunch manual so what does that mean that basically means now we have a chunk of information copied from the top secret file which he is authorized to read and write into a classified file okay so now if we have this soldier who is reading this lunch manual and now at this moment that the total has done nothing wrong okay I have the permission to read a classified file because I have the classified a clearance level so I'm reading this lunch manual and suddenly a paragraph up here this it's the plan to attack Mars and now the soldier basically got the permission to read from a top secret file so if we allow the general to write down we are creating a potential information leakage procedure so we try to prevent this thing from happening okay so that's why we said ask and write to a file if and only if the classification of always not lower than the clearance of fast so you can write up but you cannot write down and then many of you guys will say wow really are you serious are you serious are you saying that now we are allowing we're don't allow the soldier to write so since we said it can write up do you say we are going to allow the soldier to write up actually it all depends so as well I first alerted this model I'll have this I have this doubt and since this actually cost more trouble right so basically this owner will be able to append something at the end of the attack plan and change the plan so actually there are two levels of protection first there is the steel TAC there's a specialties question or a big success control so the soldier okay probably will never be given the permission to write to the top secret file okay this is the very first to control we guarantee that this thing will not happen and the second condition or the second the level another layer of protection is under very under many conditions this is transparent to user okay we're going to introduce one thing okay so let's say we have a UNIX system or a Linux system okay that's there's some real implementation doing this so let's say you see the you see the you see the folder of user and you maybe you'll see a folder called Minsk okay and let's say we have two users one is top-secret user when it's classified user okay and the top-secret user make a directory make a directory called a tech plan what does that mean that basically means the top-secret user actually make a folder under the flash misc and there is a folder called attack plan okay attack what we don't know but let's say it's the top-secret user and now the classified user without knowing anything about this folder because this folder obviously is has a clearance level of top secret because you cannot write it down you can you can only either write up or write at the same level right so whatever you're writing to should have the same level or above so this guy already has top secret so that this folder will be top secret okay now we have a classified level user and he said hey um I wanted to make a directory under misc called attack plant maybe this is just a video game planning subdirectory okay so the classified user said I want to make a directory called a tech plan and then he pushed the enter button and then the system said oh sorry the folder exist already exists so you cannot create a folder again with the same time with the same name so you cannot create it return an arrow okay so let's look at this procedure let's look at this procedure so basically the top-secret user first to make a directory called a tech plan under misc okay and then the classify the user without knowing such a subdirectory because this sub directory has a higher level clearance level this classified user cannot actually see it so he tried to make another directory with the same name and the system will say you cannot do it because this folder already exists what does that mean this is actually an information leakage problem why because now this guy with a lower clearance level know that ooh wait a minute there is a folder called attack plan already exists but when I try to see the folder I actually cannot see it what does that mean that means this folder has a higher clearance level than me okay so without doing anything illegal this user figure out that oh there is a folder called attack plan with a clearance level higher than me this caused a big information leakage problem so you realize what it happens what actually happens so you in real life also so that's why we call this actually the hosting is captive transparent to the user okay so you'll have the misc okay and when the top-secret user create a folder called attack plan what happens in the system is the system create a subdirectory the reason we put it in the dotted line is because it's invisible to the user it's invisible to the user so this attack plan the folder is not a directly under misc but it's under misc and then enter a folder with your username so now let's look at what happened when the second guy who only has the classified who only has the open sorry who only has the classified who only has the classified clearance level and create attack plan and similarly this subfolder is actually put under a directory with the username of the classified user so under this case when this classified a user created a tech plan folder it is not under the same directory of the trust of the top-secret user so that's why both folders will be created as successfully and we can prevent this information leakage problem okay so here we just want to resolve your concern you know oh you can write up you can write up it's not that easy you can write up it's not like Oh any general public will be able to write something to the nuclear launching plan of the United States so it's much more complicated than that okay
