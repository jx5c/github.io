so in the previous video we introduced about a particular module we introduced the simple property the star property and then we introduced a category to make it a two-dimensional word so that we have easy control for the access okay so now um let's look at some real example and decide what actually a a person can do to a file so now if you look at the whiteboard we have on the left side we have three person alice she has top secret and she has the category of army navy and air force so i apologize because now both army and air force both of them start with an a so i cannot use a to represent both so a stand for army and air force is really air okay a bob has a secret clearance level and it's only related to navy and c has classified or confidential security level and related to both army and air force and we have three file on the other side we have f1 it's a secret army and the navy file tool is public file and it has no category okay so if you recall in the previous video we introduced sometime you have a file with no category so why is that because if you look at this file this file is actually public what does that mean that basically means whoever you are you are allowed to read it so there's no control whatsoever so since this is a public file and we don't have to give it a category why because why do we need a category because the category is introduced to provide the second dimension of control of the access okay so now you already have this file as a public so it's really unnecessary to control the access so you don't really need this category so that's why we leave it blank okay the third file is classified uh file and it's related only to navy okay so let's see uh what the operations a every person can conduct on every file so let's assume that the discretionary access control is all okay so let's say first we compare a to f1 so a has top secret f1 has secret so the top secret is higher than secret and alice has air force navy and army navy and air force this guy is the fire is only army and the navy so basically so basically um the person alice dominated the file f1 alice dominated file f1 so alice can read the file f1 okay can alice that's the file f1 dominate alice no so alice cannot write let's cannot write to f1 okay what about alice and f2 so alice if top secret is higher than public definitely and alice and the army navy and air force is a super set of empty set so alice dominate f2 so alice can read f2 does the file dominate alice no cannot write okay so now uh we will stop here and you uh go back and look at several files so write down what operations each person can conduct on every file be very very careful because we are considering two files two operations one is read one is right so you actually have four possible uh situations which basically a person can both read and write a file a person can only read a file a person can only write to a file but not read or it could be neither be very very careful you need to stick to the definition whether or not a person can read or write to a file okay if the person dominated the file he or she can read if the file dominated the person he or she can write okay if none of the reading or writing permission or the condition is satisfied it is neither okay so go back and think about it and uh you know um as a poster class exercise to decide what operation you can actually conduct so we introduce the bella particular module so our system is safe now but there's one thing can this thing work can this thing work let's look at a simple example and then we see what's going on okay so let's say we have two person we have actually a couple uh we have the wife which is the general has the top secret and she is associated with both army and air force and of course the husband is a lieutenant only has secret clearance level and is only related to army okay so now the wife wants to write a note to the husband through the military communication channel said honey pizza for dinner okay now we have a problem wise there is a problem remember the general the wife has the clearance of top secret army and air force and with the bella particular model the bl model says very clearly that no write down you cannot write down so what does that mean let's call this a message so this is actually a file this is actually a file so the wife with the top secret army and air force categories write to a file and want to send out and since there's no write down no write down allowed that basically m will have at least the clearance level of top secret and the category of army and air force because you can only write up you cannot write down so the the file will have the clearance at least the same as the person now the problem is can the husband read this thing no why under what condition you can read you must dominate the file so that you can read but the husband has only the secret level and this file contained top secret level there's no way the husband dominated the file so you cannot read it so basically the general the wife can generate a message but the husband will not be allowed to read it so now we have a problem the system does not work okay so that's why in real life in real life how can make how can we a person will has a maximum security level and a current security level okay and the maximum security level must dominate the current security level so the subject will temporarily decrease himself or herself to the level of the current security level for communication reasons okay back to our example the wife has the top secret army and air force clearance level okay this is her this is her msl the maximum security level this is his maximum security level and we just show that if she maintains this msl she cannot communicate to her husband so what can she do she will downgrade herself to a current security level which is exactly the same as her husband so now she dropped herself to the secret and army level and then write the note and she can write to a file which has exactly the same level so now the file has the clearance of security of secret and army and she sent this to the husband and the the message and the husband has exactly the same level so now the husband can read it now we have a communication channel now we have a communication channel okay there are several things we want to pay special attention even when we do this okay the first thing is the msl must dominate csl so your maximum security level must dominate the current security level what do you mean what does this mean you can decrease your clearance you can remove category but you cannot promote yourself you cannot say oh i'm secret i promote myself to top secret no no no you cannot give yourself new category oh i'm only i'm i'm only associated with army but i'm going to promote myself and give myself access to the navy category no you cannot do that okay so the msl must dominate csl another thing is you may ask i said oh the problem is will this cause some information leakage problem you know the general the device still know all the top secret stuff right what if she writes that top secret stuff into the message okay so the bell a particular model most of time is not used to restrict a person but restrict the machine okay so if you have a computer or have a process in the computer have the top secret and actually open some files with the top secret level and as soon as the process downgrade himself or itself to the secret level all the files with top secret level will be forced to close and also watch out from the memory of the computer in other words the system will automatically enforce their bell a modular module if you downgrade or degrade yourself from a higher clearance level and more category to a lower clearance level in the last categories we are going to force you to close those files and clean out the memory and the cache so that you no longer have that access so in the system you will not have the capability to by accident copy some top secret stuff write it in this file and send it to your husband okay so i hope this will clear things up okay and with this i think we provide a very detailed explanation of the bellapadula module and there are many things uh people actually adopt in the real life and uh it's very interesting and we're going to have some homework exercise for you for the bella bottom module and i hope this clear uh some doubts that you guys have when you listen to the video provided uh in earlier this week uh with that long video okay so i will see you um and uh hope to uh finish grading the homework the the midterm very soon and provide the feedback okay bye
