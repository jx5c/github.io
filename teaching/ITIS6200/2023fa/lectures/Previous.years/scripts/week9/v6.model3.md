o welcome back so in the previous slides uh we introduced the um bella particular module and we introduced both the simple property and the star property which control the reading and the writing operations respectively okay but now we have a well we could call this small problem but basically the security clearance and classification provides only one dimensional control provide only one dimensional control for excess and how can we control access to the files or the informations that at the same level what do we mean so if you look at the whiteboard from high to low we have top secret secret classified and public or unclassified whatever you call this okay obviously we can classify the files into four groups you have top secret files secret files classified files and public files okay so now of course we could say oh we have f1 f2 f3 they are all top secret and we know that the belt particular module model is a combination of monitor access control which basically if you are not at this level you are not going to be allowed to read it at the same time it has the discretionary-based access control flavor which basically means you are going to be able to read it only if we give you the permission in other words even if we have a person alice who is also on the top secret level the alice may be able to read file one but not file two and file three because we do not give her the permission so now we face a problem the problem is oh okay so the security clearance provides only one dimensional control it's basically from top to bottom and for the files at the same level we have to use discretionary based access control to allow or disallow users to read or write to the file okay the problem is we know that under many many conditions we have a huge number of files okay when we have a huge number of files and we give everybody specific permission to read or write it will lead to a huge control file which is not a very user friendly approach so we wanted to introduce the second dimension into this control model which we can group files together in other words we can classify them into different groups and using these groups we can automatically provide this type or the second level of control that's why we introduce a second dimension we call the category we call it category in other words it's just a type of grouping file together okay each category describes a kind of information that contained in the file and both subjects and objects can be in multiple categories can be in multiple categories so the categories not necessarily have this mutual inclusive exclusive property okay so you can belong to both category one and category two simultaneously okay so let's look at an example okay so now every subject and object every person and the file needs to be described by a two-dimensional entry so if you recall what is the two-dimensional entry uh in your in your high school geometry course this is a two dimensional word right you need an x and you need a y so here the x is the classification it's the clearance level and the y's are the categories and here we want to remind you about one thing okay each file or each person can be classified or can be associated with multiple categories so that's why the second entry or the second item in this two-dimensional world is not a single item but could be a set when we say a set it can contain multiple categories for example captain john wayne who belongs to u.s army has the confidential or classified security clearance level and it is associated with the category of u.s army only in other words he is not associated with u.s air force or navy so if there is an information related to navy or air force he is not allowed to read he's not allowed to read them president obama of course has the highest highest security clearance level it will be top secret and he is allowed to read anything related to the army navy air force and in the future if we have airspace military force i believe he is also allowed to read that lunch manual for easy company is classified related only to army plan to attack mars is top secret it's related to the army navy and air force okay and if a person has the categories of army and the navy so if a person is associated with army both army and the navy then she can read objects which contain only the army files army content or navy content both army and the navy content or it contains an empty set empty set of the category we're going to show what do we mean by the empathy set of the category if the person can if the person is associated with the army in the navy categories then she can read the files with the empathy categories no categories army only navy only or both an army in the navy if the clearance and the discretionary rights allow him or her to do so okay so now we can with this two-dimensional word we can redefine the confidentiality policies okay we set a security level at security level now remember we have a two-dimensional definition of security level this is your clearance level these are the categories the level l and the c dominate the security clearance level l prime and the c prime so this is a single value this is a set if and only if l prime is smaller than or equal to l so this is lower and the c prime is a subset of c okay so let me refresh your memory a little bit about what is a subset okay but first let's say what is the set well a set is just a group of a group of items this is a set and usually is put it in a curvy braces okay for example this is a set it contains the items or values it contains the elements of a b and c okay and a b and c and most of time when we talk about sad there's no duplicate in other words you should not have something like this okay you have two a's most of time we don't allow duplicate and the order of the items does not matter in other words a b c equals to b c a so the order does not matter uh in the set okay so yeah uh this you should result in your uh either uh elementary either your first year college course or your high school math okay so then what is a subset what is a subset so a set a is a subset of a set of b if every element if every element in a is also in b for example let me write a few uh questions and you should answer true or false is a set contain only the element a a subset of a set containing a b and c true or force is a subset it's a set of bc a subset of a c d and q true force is an empty set a subset of a set containing elements a or b so so a is a subset of b if every element in a is also in b so a is also in here yes true b and c it's a b and c subset of a c d q so we have c here but on this side we don't have b so force and we have empty set contain no entry and we have a set containing aob is this formula uh in force or is true yes okay so now we have the set and the subset and let's go back to this domination relationship okay we said a security level l and the c dominate the secure level l prime c prime if and only if the security level is lower than or equal to and the c prime is a subset of c so let's look at this three examples we have george who is has secret and army and navy and the document a has classified an army so let's compare this to george with file a is s higher than c remember we have top secret and then secret then c then public or unclassified so s is higher than c and then let's look at army and the navy is army in the navy a super set of army yes or in other words is army a subset of army navy yes so that's why george dominates dark a so let's look at the second one let's look at the second one okay document b document b also has the clearance level of s so does george george has s is s higher than or equal to s yes what about the categories george is associated with army and the navy the document b is related to army and air force so is army air force a subset of army navy no why because there is an element called air force it exists in document b but not in george so george does not dominate document the b let's look at number c file c so s and s they're exactly the same we have army in the navy here we have navy here so this is a subset of army navy so george also dominate document c okay so with this let's redefine this uh this uh particular module now we can rewrite the simple and star property of the bl model a simple security model said a person s can read all if and only if as if and only if s dominate o and s has the discretionary read access so the second part we still need the discretionary read excess okay but here instead of s has a higher or the same level of security clearance we said as dominated or in other words as needed to have a higher or at least the same level of clearance as all at the same time the assets category must be a super set of the categories of o okay and then let's look at the other property the star property said s can write to all if and only if o dominate s and as has the discretionary writing access permission to the file okay so that's why we call the bell of particular module of no read up and no write it down okay so in this way we have a s and we have o you can read it to the same level or read it down but you cannot write down and you can write up or write to the same level but not write that so that's why we say no read up you cannot you cannot read up you cannot write it down the no write down guarantee that you cannot uh you cannot cough the information leakage okay
