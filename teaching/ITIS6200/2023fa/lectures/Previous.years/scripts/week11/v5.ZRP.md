and good morning and welcome back to the 6280 200 and we're gonna continue this zero knowledge proof and in the following section we're going to give you a separate example of general knowledge proof it is still young graph theory problems and the reason we want to give you this second example if you'll recall in the first example while in the very first example we give you a cave walking through the example which is trivial and just to show you it is possible to do there a lot of proof and in the second example we give you a graph isomorphism question example which is very very similar to this cave what's truly example right very very similar and in that example we show exactly why every run you should ask two questions but I'm only going to answer one and in the following example is still related to graph theory we're going to show you the problem before the property is why it is a very tricky part it is very tricky part to construct this new problem and how Bob if you handle it carelessly how can Bob to learn some information from your approach from your approach ok and here is it ok so in the you before this two videos we post a two we posted two videos related to graph theory one is graph isomorphism which you have already watched understand what under what circumstance we call to graph there as a morphic and that the second is called harmon and psycho which basically we have a graph and you are supposed to work like work in a cycle that touch every node exactly once you you touch every node exactly once and you back to the original starting position for example if we have a graph look like this so this is a square you'll start from AP and then you go to sea eagle 2t you go back okay this is ha-meidan psycho you go through every vertex exactly once and go back to the original figure and how about we have now we add an edge between B and D okay so you can still go through ABCD but what about we go something like this we go through B and to C to D and to be and to a now we're cook now you go through B twice you go through B price and a B is not the you know B is not both the starting point and the ending points okay so this basically we want to show you this Harmelin cycle problem is not a very trivial problem and under many conditions they it's also related to something called a salesperson problem which basically we want you to admit it every city exactly once and go back to the starting position starting position so this is a very tough problem and we're going to construct a total knowledge problem based on this okay so let's say we have a figure t1 and of course we have our old friends and B Alice will say that Bob you know what I know a Harmelin cycle of the graph G 1 and Bob said no you don't know ok let's run this duel knowledge proof approach to show that I actually know the Harvard and cycle in this in this graph G 1 ok so what can we do we still described a single round ok first Alice will generate g2 which is isomorphic to t1 so first Alice will generate a g2 which is isomorphic to about what does that mean if there is actually a hardened sac hole in t1 there is or Hamedan cycle in G 2 and also Alice not having a cycle in G 2 and that Alice commits g2 to Bob okay if you compare this video to the previous video you will notice that there's something very tricky that is different in the previous example when we use the graph as a morphic problem as the example we said we have G 1 G 2 Alice will generate the g3 and Alice will just give G 3 to Bob and it will give up g 3 to pop you remember that okay and here we never say that islets will give G 2 to Bob on the contrary pallets will commit generate a commitment of G 2 to Bob we're going to show you why we want this and why we are only going to give G 2 a committed the g2 is commitment to but not directly Hondo g2 to Bob and then 3 Bob will generate two challenges generate two challenges and the Alice is going to answer only welcome Bob can either challenge Alice to prove that g1 and g2 are isomorphic or Bob can ask alice to show the hardened cycle of t2 but love bows but not both okay so let us stop here for like 10 seconds so that you can review we have it we have a figure t1 and there is a hominin cycle in t1 Alice will prove to Bob that she actually knows the feminine cycle so Alice will generate a new graph G 2 which is as a morphic duty but so if there is a hominin second t1 there is a hominid second G 2 LS generated the commitment of G 2 and gave the commitment to Bob not directly the graph and then there will be two challenges and Alice is going to respond to only one of them the challenge number one is that you need to show that a t1 to t2 there as a morphic in other words Alice need to show the vertex mapping the vertex mapping between Siva energy - okay if Alice enter this challenge I'm basically showing Oh see these two figures they're exactly the same that the node here is actually the node here so on and so forth but you will not learn anything from how the Hartmann and cycle will be generated in the figure or Bob can ask alice to show him the harden cycle of G to the Hartmann and psycho of g2 okay either way so this is basically a single round of procedure and let's look at what it's the problem and why we use these two questions okay so first thing first if Alice actually knows the Hamelin if Alice actually knows the Hermit and psycho of G 1 if Alice actually know the feminine psyche of G 1 and that since Alice generated G 2 from g1 Alice will be able to show the hominin cycle of G 2 so basically Alice can respond to both of the challenge Alice will be able to show how the T 1 T 2 are the same or Alice can direction in hominid cycle of G 2 so if Alice actually know the secret she can respond to the challenge and she's fine okay if Alice actually not know the secret not know the secret what does I mean so Alice does not know the Hamilton sec of g1 there are two things Alice can do Alice can either generate G 2 from T one okay so Alice does not know the Hamilton cycle of T 1 but she can still manipulate the nose into you want to generate a brand new graph those two graph are exactly the same which basically means since Alice does not know the Harmony and psychology 1 she will not know the fermion sake of G 2 which means she can answer challenge one but not challenge to or let's say well Alice is still unknown do not know that does not know the Cambrian psycho but palace will generate a brand new graph of G - which has an her maiden cycle what does I mean so let's say we know that a t1 has a nose do I have a nose I will first generate a notes and I will draw a circle connected this and notes and then I will add some random age random edge into the graph to make sure the total edge is the same as t1 because I generate this g2 from scratch and I know exactly which one is the hominin cycle I can't answer Challenger to the hominin cycle challenge but can I showed you one Anna t2 there as a Moffitt no I cannot if you recall graph isomorphism is a tough problem so if this is t1 and this is t2 I might just randomly generate it has happened to have the same number of edge and node as t1 I could not figure out the effort as a morphism so I cannot answer this challenge so I can either answer challenge 1 but not not challenge - or I can't answer challenger 2 I show you the hominin cycle but not challenge one so still I have half chance to cheat you if I do not know the secret and again if we run X rounds the chance that you can fool me in electrons will be half to the power of X which decrease very very fast so basically if Alice does not know the secret Alice still will not be able to fool me okay so now we basically answer the question is if Alice knows the secret Alice will be able to successfully answer the challenge every time if Alice does not know the secret ballots can either generate t2 from t1 but she will not be able to show how many cycle or Alice generate a brand new figure which contains a hamid and a cycle but she will not know the vertex mapping between t1 t2 so either way you have half chance got picked and if we run the minimum rounds there's a good chance you are going to be you are going to be identified okay so Bob is pretty happy pretty happy and now let's go back to our earlier point we said in zero knowledge proof is that okay Alice got two challenges but Alice else is only going to respond to what why look at this okay look at this you have t1 and you show me the T 2 and we know g2 has are coming in a cycle okay if Alice respond to both of the challenges which basically means you need to show me how the t1 and t2 are vertex mapping between each other and also you show me the Hamelin cycle in t2 and because I know how the nodes are mapped between t1 t2 I will be able to figure out the hammer and cycle in T 1 which will be no longer a zero knowledge proof so here will show you that there are two challenges Alice should only answer one but not both because if Alice and suppose Bob will be able to know the secret okay so now let's go back to the most important the reason we want the second example if you recall if you recall when we say Alice generated T 2 and then Alice will generate a commitment will generate a commitment of g2 and giving it to Bob Alice will not directly give g2 to Bob why why what's the difference between a commitment of g2 and what is the difference between I generate a commitment of g2 and give you the commitment or I directly give you G - okay so let's say Alice directly gives g2 to mom Alex directly gives g2 to Bob so Bob will always choose the second challenge which basically I want you to show me the Hamilton cycle in G - since Alice already gave T - to Bob and now Bob asked you to show me the hammer and cycle in G - so basically you have a G - I will just about five points let's say this is a visit - grazie - and the bomb said okay show me the Hamilton cycle in G - and Alice will just add water Harlan cycle in G - okay what is good for Bob now Bob Luke at the Hamilton cycle in T - remember bob has G - directly has the whole graph of the whole graph and now Alice label a hammer than cycle in this Geograph what can Ballard Bob will look at every edge in this feminine cycle will look at every edge in this Harmelin cycle and he will see that o in T to the Hamilton cycle started from node 1 so it started from node a and then goes through go to know the B and then go to Nazi remember this a B and C they are nose in T - they're not notes in C what however I can count okay in T - in T - a has three neighbors and the B has five neighbors okay C has seven neighbors I can count right I has I already have G - and you show me the whole hammer then psycho so I will be able to count that oh it comes from a node with three neighbors to a node with five neighbors to a node with seven neighbors so what can I learn now I needed to go back to look at the t1 which nodes have three neighbors which nodes have five neighbors which nodes have seven neighbors so now I needed to I needed to try start from a three neighbor node to a five neighbor node to a seven neighbor node so what does that mean it will drastically shrink the search space for Bob for the Hamilton cycle in t1 remember it's zero knowledge proof want you to make sure that during the whole interaction procedure you need to disclose as little information as possible to the other party and this obviously violated that because now if I challenge the Hamilton psycho unity to I will know exactly oh the whole Hamilton cycle started from a node with three neighbors go to a five neighbor guy get it go to a seven neighbor guy then go to a the neighbor guy and a three neighbor guy again so now I can I I grouped the notes based on the number of neighbors and I will drastically shrink the search space of the possible Hamilton cycle it will make the life of Bob much either to search the Hammerman cycle in see what okay that is why we don't want to give we don't want to give the whole t-to to pop on the contrary we're all they going to give a commitment of T to to Bob and then we have to answer one question what in the god is the commitment of a G - okay so let's zoom back or let's step back for one second so what is a graph it graph it basically we have V points V vertex ins and the edges okay that's that's what a graph is right at the edge we'll just connect two points and of course we can give the edge and index number we could say add one connect a node a be at to connect nodes CF add three connect nodes PQ so on so forth okay and here is what the commitment we're gonna provide Alice provided to Bob Alice will generate a lot of keys and she will encrypt every edge wears a different key for example I will encrypt at one so everyone Connect node a and know the B and I will encrypted with k1 k2 okay three all the way up okay so Ellis will give Bob or the encrypted message will give my father encrypted message okay and now if Bob asked Alice Oh show me t1 and t2 there are automatic show me G 1 and G 2 there as a morphic this is so if Bob asked Alice said show me t1 to t2 they're isomorphic okay Alice will open all of the encryption key and show all the edges to Bob and show him how the nodes in g2 are mapped to the notes in g1 okay if Bob asked Alice to show that D minor G 2 there as a Norfolk then open all the key open all the encryption on the contrary if Bob had challenged Alice said okay Palace show me the Hamilton cycle in G to show me the hominin second T to Alice will open only the edges in Hamilton cycle well that's a mean Alice will provide exactly the keys remember there are V nodes in the graph so I will give you the keys okay for example if I have a graph I have three notes to do a hammer than stack of the three notes and neither three edges right so if I have V nodes in the graph I need V ads to construct a hammer and cycle I'm going to expose those edges in the Hamilton cycle I'm going to give you the key of the ashed in the Hamilton cycle and you can see that Oh from a to P P to see C to D et tu e e to F and then back to it there will be V edges and every edge will connect to notes and those V apps will construct a graph and sorry will construct a Hamilton cycle what's the benefit I give you only I give you only the edges you don't know anything about other ABS Bob will not know anything about other edges what does that mean that basically means prevent Bob from deriving out the degree or in other words when we say degree of a node is actually the number of neighbors this will prevent Bob from deriving out the number of neighbors of every node in t2 so now Bob can no longer figure out that Bob can no longer figure out that the Hamilton cycle actually come from a node with three neighbors to a node with five neighbors to a node with seven neighbors Bob will not know that Bob will only know that oh there are V notes and there are V ads connecting them together so now what can I do I cannot do anything right because I don't figure out anything out so in this way Bob will not will not know what will be the number of neighbors of every node in the graph of the edge in the Hubbard cycle for example because I always show you the ad from A to B you will not know how many neighbors does a have and how many neighbors that's behalf so you will not know that this edge actually connect a node with three neighbors - ain't no the with five neighbors so we want to minimize the information that we disclose to Bob this will not impact the challenge this will not impact the challenge or the zero knowledge proof again if Alice does not know the Hamilton cycle if Alice does not know the Hammerman cycle in t1 she can still generate a G - based on t1 but when Bob said show me the Hamilton cycle Alice will not know which V ads should I expose to Bob because this V ash are not some random V ads you need to expose to Bob those V ads needs to need to form a cycle and every node appear twice exactly in those V ads it start from it and end with it event okay so with this we introduced after the caveman example we introduce two examples of zero knowledge proof both of them are related to graph theory and in the first example is very very similar to that caveman example in the second example we want to show you why it is very very tricky to construct the new problem and also what should you share with the other party so that you can convince him that you actually know the secret without disclosing too much of the information so with this we finish introducing this interactive they will not if proof and we still have one thing we need to cover in the first section of the next week which is none interactive zero knowledge proof and we are going to show you why in the net interactive you are not a proof you need many many more rounds to convince the other party ok so I have a stop here and hope you enjoy the weekend and enjoy the Easter holiday ok have a good one bye
