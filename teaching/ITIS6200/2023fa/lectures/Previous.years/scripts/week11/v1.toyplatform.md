ood morning everyone and welcome back to 62 180 200 so I think we have finished talking about the Bitcoin and we're going to move to our next topic which is which is a very interesting topic and that belief before security experts actually proposed this approach and that many of you probably will believe we will think that this can be done and the topic we're going to discuss is the zero knowledge proof so you can see we actually have that tongue show that in the slides so if you have watched any of the spy movies or military strategy movies thriller movies so under many many conditions you know you're going to see or you're going to watch it's in which the two parties will talk to each other and one party will say yes I know the secret but I cannot tell you because if I tell you the secret I will have to kill you you must remember some of this since so we just go to youtube and we type in I could tell you but that I would have to kill you and this are the all the video clips that showed up that you know they will have to kill you if they told you all that okay so you know what I mean so of course you know the security guys are pretty paranoid and they would always think that oh um hmm it's a way that I could prove to you that I actually know the secret but you will not be able to you know but you will not be able to figure out what the secret is so in this way I could tell you the secret oh no no I I could prove to you that I know the secret but I don't have to kill you okay so this is a very interesting idea but before we go to some any before we go anything that is formal like a real scientific question that first look at a fake question and the see how things works okay so let's say there is an Asian the tribe very old group of people have been there for gazillion years and of course this tribe of people know some secret okay so this is a cave entrance this is a cave entrance okay and that there is a secret door there's a secret door at the end of the cave so basically you'll walk in this side you can come to the door or you can walk in and turn right and walk till this door okay so if you know the secret code you can open the door if you do not know the secret code you cannot open the door okay so one day we have two person of course our old friend Alice and Bob and Alice said hey Bob you know what I know the code for the secret door Bob said now you're just laughing you don't know a thing about the secret code Alice will say that of course I know reality you know the secret code tell me tell me and I will believe you Alice said sorry I could not tell you if I tell you all I would have to kill you so now hmm we have to think about a mechanism so that Alice will convince Bob that she actually knows the secret code but she's not going to tell Bob the secret code okay so if you watch the video till this moment please pause the video think about an approach how can Alice prove to Bob that she actually knows the code without telling him okay so let's pause the video okay I hope you have thought about an approach so here is some simple approach that I can you imagine okay so Alice and the Bob will both enter the cave entrance and the Bob will say hey Alice let's make it a very simple that you can prove to me that you actually know the secret code without telling me anything Bob said I will stand here I will not follow you okay so if you can get into the cave from this side and the get out of the cave from the other side then you prove to me that you actually know the secret code why Bob will stand here Alice will enter the cave Alice will enter the cave and a leads will get in from this side and the only way that she can get out from the other side is that she penetrated the door to penetrate the secret door she will need to know the secret code okay so Bob said if you can do this you can prove to me that you know the secret and at the same time if the cave is deep enough if the cave is deep enough when Bob stands here when a let's read the secret code to open the door Bob will not hear a thing so in this way we satisfy the requirement Alice proved to Bob that she actually knows the secret without letting Bob know the secret okay fantastic if you have thought about this approach congratulation and of course we all know that the security guys are you know a really kind of paranoid so they will not use some simple approach like this okay the security guys are really paranoid and they're not going to do something as simple as that because that's no fun right so so Alice and Bob after they take this 6282 100 cause they said that's too simple that's no fun let's have a more interesting approach to accomplish this task okay so this is what we're going to do so at the very beginning Bob will stand here so Bob will stand outside of the entrance and he will not be able to see what's going on so Alice will get into the cave and Alice will run them Lee select the one side to get in when we say Alice randomly select the one side we mean Alice could either be here or Alice could be here okay Bob will not know because bob was outside of the cave and he does not know which side she picks and we use both of this dotted line to show Alice could either be here or be here after Alice hide while Alice will shout toward at the outside of the cave said I'm ready get in okay so father knows that Alice has hidden well and he can get in and this is Bob will get into here when Paul get in Bob will flip a coin Bob will flip a coin if the coin is had Bob will ask Alice to come out from left if the coin is tail what will happen is the Queen's tail its what will happen of course if it's the tail Baba will ask Alice to come out from right okay so this thing we call it one round we call the one round at the very beginning pop that's not know which side Alice pick and then Bob will ask alice to come out either from the left side or right side and Alice needed to follow and less needed to fall so let's say at the end of round one Alice successfully come out from the side that Bob asks so let's see and the end of round one Bob said okay come on from this side and Alice actually follow the instruction and come out from the side that Bob specified does this prove to Bob that Alice actually knows the secret does this prove so if Alice could follow the instruction of pop for one round does this prove to Bob that she actually knows the secret code no why why because Bob doesn't know from which side alleys entered Bob doesn't know from which side Alice entered so Bob will ask Alice to come out from one side of the cave from one side of the cave there is 50% chance that Alice does not need to go through the door okay there is 50% chance that Alex does not needed to open the door because she can just to come out from the original side there is a 50% chance that Alice will actually open the door and get out from the other side okay so if you are only running this thing for one round you have 50% chance got called by Alice which means even if Alice does not know the secret code Alice has 50% chance to succeed for one round okay so 50% chance obviously is not good enough for us right because now the bad guy has too much chance to call us we don't like that so what can we do what can we do we run then again we run that many routes so we know that for a single round Alice that can successfully cheat us in other words a lift of the know the secret key but she can actually follow the instruction the chance is 50% okay what about the torrents if we run the protocol two rounds and the boast round Alice can successfully come out from this side that we specify but actually Alice does not know the secret key what is the chance of that happening we know everyone is 50% the first round 50% is second round 50% so now you're you have 1/4 chance that you can follow the instruction even if you don't know the instruction even if you know if you even if you do not know the secret code so what about iran's so the chance that you don't know the secret code but you can successfully come out from the right side for uncompetitive continuous rounds consecutive rounds is why in 2 to the power of n we know that so since we are a computer most of you guys are committed science majors we know that 2 to the power of n is a good friend of us we know that a 2 to the power of 10 will equal to 1,024 2 to the power of 20 is roughly 1 million so in other words if we run this thing 20 times the chance that Alice can call us is only one unit 1 million okay which basically is roughly zero which basically if we run this protocol 20 times Bob can be pretty sure that yes I think you actually know the secret code and you actually know the secret code and we don't need to run their father so in fact we can push this number to be as close to zero as possible as you want so Bob said Oh 1 million is not good enough I want it to be 1 trillion or 1 Giga wenyan 1 Giga that's okay if you want to the chance that Alice can call you it's 1 in 10 to the power of 9 we just arraigned it 30 times that's totally fine no matter how small you want the chance to be we can push it we can implement it so in this way we achieve this zero knowledge proof of this a very simple case you might ask that oh um you know this is ridiculous why is this ridiculous you know at the very beginning we have this very simple approach we have this very simple Pro that a and B walk into the cave together and B will see Alice come in from this side get out from that side will that just be a simple enough right I totally agree with you if you know this is a real-life example that Alice and Bob can both go into this cave then that simple approach will work however you have to think about one thing why you're in addition to those real-life zero knowledge proof you have you have to think about one thing which is how can you achieve it online okay how can you achieve it online so this will become much hotter this will become much hotter for example um you know if it's a line pop can only stay here sorry so if it's online about cannot do that same okay on the contrary we're going to show you several examples that Bob can propose this type of challenge again again and for every time we don't have to have this percentage of 50% okay as long as it's smaller than one if we run it enough times we can push the chance that Alice can cheat us as small as possible as we want okay so this is basically a simple example of this at zero knowledge proof but we have to go back to the slides and see something so in this slide we show a general procedure of G of zero knowledge proof so first thing Alice will generate a new problem based on the original one so remember there is a problem and Alice claimed that she knows the answer and Bob does not believe her okay so Alice needed to prove to Bob that she actually knows the answer without history so Alice actually needed to prove to Bob that she knows the answer without telling Bob the answer okay so what can Alice do the early procedure is Alice will first generate a new problem based on the original problem and the two problem are isomorphic in other words they have exactly the same difficulty level okay they have the same difficulty level this is a very tricky part okay Anna Baba should not find an eating measure to transfer back to the original problem okay and then Alice commits the solution to the new problem to Bob with a protocol so don't worry about this beef commitment protocol what don't worry about this what is a big commitment don't worry about that so let's say Alice commits the solution to the new problem to Bob okay the commit here means that Alice generate a signature or the hash result of the solution so Bob could not derive out the solution based on the commitment but at the same time if Alice commits to the solution Alice could not change pellets could not change okay so then Bob can challenge Alice with one of the question Baba will ask Alice to either prove that the two problems are as a law Vic which basically means if you can solve the new problem you will be able to solve the other problem or Bob can ask Alice to show the solution to the new problem to the new problem not the solution to the old problem okay and then the procedure will repeat and q bar is satisfied so what do we actually mean what do we actually mean so basically we have to person we have Alice and Bob and this is the or reader no question we call it a question what so Alice knows does answer to question one Bob does not know Alice need to prove to Bob that oh I know the answer to question one so what are we going to do Alice will generate a new question called a question - Alice will need to show generate a brand new question in which question to the question one and the question - they are isomorphic which means if you can solve question one you can so question two or if you can so question two Bob will believe that you can solve question 1 here is a very tricky part here is very tricky part those two are isomorphic if you know the answer to question 2 I will believe that you have the capabilities of question 1 but based on that you should not be able to figure out the answer to question 1 ok how do we do that we're going to show you some real-life examples later but let's say currently we can do that and then Alice will pretend to things it's either Alice will Shh Alice question and one question question - they are isomorphic or we have a solution the question too okay so basically Alice prepare two things one is Alice could show that a question 1 question 2 there are actually a zoomorphic or Alice could actually generated a solution to question 2 so there are two separate envelopes there are two separate envelopes and then Bob can ask Alice to open one and only one of those two envelopes so Bob can either ask Alice to show that the question 1 question 2 they are actually as a morphic or Barker ask Alice to actually show the solution to question 2 but not both not both not both this is just like Bob asked Alice to come out to ask Alice to come out from either the left side or right side of the case and there goes okay so this is one round so again like we said there's still some chance that Alice will come up so what do we do now Bob Ellis will generate a Brendan your question called q3 again again after presented the q3 after presenting the q3 Alice will generate a two new envelope what envelope will show that q1 in a q3 are isomorphic or another envelope is solution of q3 and a Bob will ask Alice to open one and only one of the envelope these two envelopes are independent from the envelopes for q2 so whatever Bob asked for q2 know he does not have to ask you the same question for q3 so this is the second round we can run this again and again and again until Bob is happy enough it's happy enough okay so we're stuck here so we illustrate what is their knowledge proof and we actually give you a example of this zero knowledge proof of course this is not a really computer science problem so we're going to in the next videos we're going to show you how can we do zero knowledge proof of real problem and of course and how can we do those non-interactive zero knowledge proof so okay I will see you for the subsequent videos have a good day bye
