 </p>

	  <h3>Time and place</h3>
	  <p>Tuesdays and Thursdays, 10:00am -11:15am-12:30pm, College of Education 010.</p>
	  <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
	  <p><a href="">Computer Science 51</a>. Also
	    recommended is <a href="">Computer
	    Science 121</a>.
			Students must have <b>good programming skills</b>, be <b>very comfortable</b> with <b>recursion,
	    proofs, basic mathematical ideas and
	    notations, including sets, relations,
	    functions, and induction</b>. See the <a href="schedule.html">schedule</a> for some suggested background reading on some of these concepts.
			Feel free to contact the instructor if you have questions about the requirements or other aspects of the course.
	  </p>

	  <p> Two points to emphasize: (1) this is not an introduction to programming; students should already know how to program, ideally in at least couple of languages. (2) you must be  <b>very comfortable</b> with <b>recursion, proofs, basic mathematical ideas and
	    notations, including sets, relations, functions, and
	    induction</b>.</p>



	    <h3>Homeworks, exams, and grading</h3>


 (from Chao) Attendance/Participation is a critical part of this class. Although we will not meet face to face, we will still count your accomplishments of the class slides, homework, projects, and other required activities. The weight of each activity in the final grade will be posted. Everyone is expected to finish every session and participate. Based on what I see, very frequently a student drops from "A" to "B" or "B" to "C" just because she/he/they miss one homework.
	    <p>There will be an in-class midterm and a final exam. There
	      will be about 4 homework assignments. Some of the assignments will contain a programming
	      component in  OCaml, Coq, and Haskell and some other
	      languages. Prior knowledge of these languages is not required.</p>
	    <ul>
	      <li>Midterm: In class; time: to be determined.</li>
	      <li>Final exam: time: to be determined</li>
	      <li>Homeworks: 4 assignments. Some will contain a programming
		component.
		See the <a href="schedule.html">Schedule</a> page for due dates, and the <a href="assignments.html">Assignments</a> page for details of the assignments.</li>
	    </ul>
	    <p>Your grade will be determined by a weighted average of your
	      scores on homework assignments, the midterm
	      exam, the final exam, and class participation. The percentage
	      breakdown (roughly and subject to change) is 50% homework
	      assignments, 20% midterm, 25% final exam, and 5% participation
	      (which includes
	      attendance and participation in class, section, and office
	      hours, and contributing to online discussion).</p>




	      <h3>Textbooks</h3>
	      <p> There is no required textbook for the course. In most cases, the class materials should suffice. The instructor will provide written lecture notes where helpful. </p>

	      <p>See the <a href="resources.html">Resources</a> page for additional material
		that you can examine. </p>
