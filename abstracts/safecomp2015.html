  <p class="firstpara">Software systems sense and affect real world objects and processes in
order to realize important real-world systems. For these systems to function correctly, such software should obey constraints inherited from the real world.
Typically, neither important characteristics of real-world entities nor the relationships between such entities and their machine-world representations are
specified explicitly in code, and important opportunities for detecting errors due
to mismatches are lost. To address this problem we introduce real-world types
to document in software both relevant characteristics of real-world entities and
the relationships between real-world entities and machine-level representations.
These constructs support specification and automated static detection of such
mismatches in programs written in ordinary languages. We present a prototype
implementation of our approach for Java and case studies in which previously
unrecognized real-world type errors in several real systems were detected.</p>
