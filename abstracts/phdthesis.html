  <p class="firstpara">Software systems, especially cyber-physical systems, sense and influence realworld entities under the control of software logic in order to realize desired real-world
behaviors. Such software systems are based upon three essential components: (1) a
computing platform, (2) a set of physical entities with which the computing platform
interacts, and (3) the relationship between the first two components. These three
components seem familiar, and the third component seems trivial. In fact, the third
component, the relationship, is crucial, because it defines how logical values read and
produced by the computing platform will be affected by and will affect the various
physical entities.</p>
<p>Formally, the relationship between real-world entities and a computer system’s
logic is the interpretation of the logic. Software logic is necessarily formal, but, in
practice, interpretations are usually documented informally and incompletely, and
programmers treat elements in software logic as if they were the real-world entities
themselves. As a result, faults are introduced into systems due to unrecognized
discrepancies, and executions end up violating constraints inherited from the real
world. The results are software and system failures and adverse downstream
consequences. </p>

<p>
This dissertation argues that, to mitigate such risks, software engineers should
produce not just traditional software, but a new engineering structure, the interpreted
formalism. The structure combines software logic with an explicitly documented
interpretation. Among other things, an interpretation documents differences that arise
inevitably between real-world values and corresponding logic values. An interpreted
formalism provides centralized documentation of a system’s software and its intended
relationship to the real world in an analyzable form, facilitating fault detection. </p>

<p>An implementation of the interpretation, real-world type, is introduced. For a
specific software system, an interpretation is composed of a set of real-world types, and
an interpreted formalism is implemented as a real-world type system combined with a
software system. </p>

<p>The pragmatics of the interpreted formalism concept are illustrated by conducting
case studies on open-source software systems of different sizes. The interpreted
formalism is evaluated from several viewpoints: (a) overall feasibility, (b) error
detection capability, (c) effort level required, and (d) scalability. The results of the case studies suggest that (1) the interpreted formalism concept can be used on modern
software systems of different sizes, (2) the technology is capable of detecting real errors that violate real-world constraints, and (3) the effort required from engineers for
developing and using the interpreted formalism can be reduced greatly by an automated
synthesis framework developed as part of this research. </p>
