<p>Thanks for your interest in my research group. If you email me about joining my group, I will try to reply. However, I may not have the energy to reply to them all. Emails that are clearly mass mailings, and/or are focused on research areas that are not relevant to me will be discarded.
<!--If you include the words &ldquo;languid bubble&rdquo; in your subject line, then you will be more likely to receive a reply, since it will indicate that you have read this page. -->
</p>

<p>Here are some answers to commonly asked questions.</p>


<p class="faq-question">Are you looking for graduate students?</p>
<p class="faq-answer">
  Yes! I am happy to work with self-motivated PhD students who are interested in build secure and pragmatic systems with formal methods.
  </p>

<p class="faq-question">Are you looking for undergraduate students?</p>
<p class="faq-answer">Yes! I am interested in working with undergraduates. If you are currently an undergraduate and are interested in getting involved in research (which could be a senior thesis, summer research, or working together during the term), get in touch and we can discuss possibilities.
<!-- As most of my research uses programming language techniques and abstractions, it is best if you have taken <a href="http://www.seas.harvard.edu/courses/cs152/">CS 152: Programming Languages</a>, <a href="http://www.seas.harvard.edu/courses/cs153/">CS 153: Compilers</a>, or similar. -->

<p class="faq-answer"> General information for UNCC undergraduates
    interested in research in Computer Science is <a				      href="https://cci.charlotte.edu/research/undergraduate-research-opportunities">available here</a>.</p>

<!--p class="faq-answer"> If you are an undergraduate but not at Harvard, there may be a summer <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/">Research Experience for Undergraduates</a> (REU) available via one of the research projects I am involved with. Please note that I do not advise undergraduates long distance.
</p-->


<p class="faq-question">How can I join your group?</p>
<p class="faq-answer">If you are already at UNCC, stop by my office to chat, or send me an email to arrange a time to meet.</p>
<p class="faq-answer">If you have already been admitted to UNCC, get in touch with an email.</p>
<p class="faq-answer">If you have not been admitted to UNCC, then please apply through the normal channels. Information about Ph.D. in Computing and Information Systems (Software and Information Systems (SIS) track) can be found <a href="https://cci.charlotte.edu/academics/software-and-information-systems/phd-sis-track">here</a>.
<!--Applications are due in December, and the graduate admissions committee convenes in early spring to review all applications. -->
</p>
<p class="faq-answer">
</p>

<p class="faq-question">What is your research about?</p>
<p class="faq-answer">My research uses formal methods, e.g., programming languages techniques, verification techniques, and mathematical proofs, to help build secure, efficient, and dependable systems. Take a look at some of my <a href="./publications.html">recent publications</a> to get a feel for what I work on.</p>

<!--p class="faq-question">Can I do a summer (or six-month or one-year) internship with you?</p>
<p class="faq-answer">Unfortunately I do not typically have such positions available, regardless of whether you are self-funded or not.</p-->

<p class="faq-question">I'm a student in another country. Can I do a Ph.D. at UNCC?</p>
<p class="faq-answer">Foreign students are able to apply through the <a href="https://gradadmissions.charlotte.edu/admissions/doctoral">normal channels</a>. More information about <a href="https://cci.charlotte.edu/">CCI</a> graduate programs can be found <a href="https://cci.charlotte.edu/graduate-programs">here</a>. However, you should make sure you know about the application process, which can take up to a year. You can also find more information for international applicants
<a href="https://gradadmissions.charlotte.edu/admissions/international-applicants">here</a>.
</p>

<p class="faq-answer">Also, if possible, make sure that the people who are writing your recommendation letters are aware of what admissions committees are looking for in recommendation letters. Shriram Krishnamurthi's <a href="http://www.cs.brown.edu/~sk/Memos/Grad-School-Recos/">Advice to Graduate School Recommendation Letter Writers</a> may be helpful.</p>

<p class="faq-question">Where can I find some more official information about applying to grad school at UNCC?</p>
<p class="faq-answer">Take a look at the <a href="https://gradadmissions.charlotte.edu/admissions">UNCC page for prospective graduate students</a>, which includes a link to a <a href="https://gradadmissions.charlotte.edu/apply/faqs">FAQ</a>.
