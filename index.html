<h2>Research Interests</span></h2>

<p>
The primary goal of my research is to advance the state of the art of formal methods for correctness and security of computer systems, especially cyber-physical systems (CPSs), and to develop tools and techniques to help construct systems that are correct and secure.
Formal methods are crucial for security goals, because they can show that no attack strategy will cause a system to misbehave. For the past several years, my research approach is to investigate sound, powerful, and pragmatic formal reasoning techniques for safety and security properties, and develop efficient enforcement mechanisms of these properties in constructing practical systems. <!-- See my <a href="#researchproject">projects</a> for more details. -->

<!--Many complex systems, especially CPSs, are safety and security critical. Systematic, correct, and secure system design and implementation are urgently needed, and I believe that rigorous formal methods are essential for substantial improvements. They enable reasoning from logical or mathematical specifications of the behaviors
of software systems and offer rigorous proofs that all system behaviors meet some desirable properties. -->

	<li><span style="font-size:24px;"><span style="font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;"><a href="https://github.com/HarvardPL/Co-InflowPrototype">Co-Inflow</a> is a coarse-grained dynamic information-flow control mechanism for Java language. By careful design choices and defaults, a programmer typically needs to add very few annotations to a Java program to convert it to a Co-Inflow program with relatively good precision. Additional annotations can improve precision. We achieve this tradeoff between precision and annotation burden by instantiating and specializing recent advances in coarse-grained IFC for a Java-like setting, and by using opaque labeled values: a restriction of labeled values that the Co-Inflow runtime automatically and securely creates and uses.</span></span></li>
	<br />
	<li><span style="font-size:24px;"><span style="font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;"><a>SecPhy</a> is a framework for modeling and analyzing sensor attacks on cyber-physical systems, using the formalism of hybrid programs. It formalizes and analyzes two relational properties of a system&rsquo;s robustness: (1) whether a system&rsquo;s safety property can be influenced by sensor attacks, and (2) whether a system&rsquo;s high-integrity state can be affected by sensor attacks. These relational properties is characterized by defining an equivalence relation between a system under attack and the original unattacked system. That is, the system satisfies the robustness properties if executions of the attacked system are appropriately related to executions of the unattacked system.</span></span></li>

	<li><span style="font-size:24px;"><span style="font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;"><a href="https://github.com/jx5c/Real-World-Type-System/tree/master/RWTChecker">Interpreted formalism</a> is a software analog of the notion of an informal interpretation from classical logic. It targets at improving software dependability by introducing real-world semantics to software systems, and conduct comprehensive type checking based on these semantics.</span></span></li>
